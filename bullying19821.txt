				Hi Ada thanks for reading. And no I have not taken this any further yet as it has only recently occurred. I have spoken to the teacher (who suggested the school psyche) and have written a lengthy letter to the headmaster. His reply was to address a completely separate request (which I had also included in the letter to save writing twice) and ignored the bulk of the letter. I would have expected at least an invite for my partner and I to go and discuss the situation. Not satisfactory. I don't know... Maybe it's because it's coming to the end of the school year in Australia so wrong timing to deal with these issues... or else blinkers are on? I said I'd be happy for my child to see the school psyche about his social behaviour so we'll give them a week to see what they come up with.<br><br>Another thing is i do speak to the parents of the kids involved (playground talk) and am wondering whether it's easier just to approach them direct and let them know what's been going on and ask if they would mind speaking to their children. I guess if the situation was reversed, I would like them to approach me rather than go to the school but that's just me. The school has guidelines against this as I suppose it could lead to confrontations - we all like to think our children can do no wrong <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">. Also I worry about comeback for my child as in they will think he's a rat and further isolate him. It's a no win situation for him  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad">
