				I am really sorry your Dad is behaving like this.  Do you think you could sit down with him when he is in a calmer mood and exlplain that his behaviour upsets you and why.  Ask him to clarify what he means by stuff like you having to find somewhere else to live and that he can't say things like that spur of the moment.  I hope this works and that he realises it is not an acceptable way to behave.  Keep posting.<br><br>Cracked
