				As to whether Eric and Dylan were bullied, I don't know for sure. Do I believe they were bullied? Yes. Does it excuse their actions on that fateful day? Absolutely not! <br><br>I say this because I was bullied relentlessly and viciously while in junior high and high school and I remember very well the rage I felt inside, which begged to burst forth but didn't. At times there seemed to be no end to the torment and I was driven to a suicide attempt at age 14. I'm blessed to have survived the attempt.<br><br>There were times, though, when the thought of doing something foolish crossed my mind. But I didn't entertain that thought. Sure, I could've brought a gun to school and shot up the place, but what good would it have done? It would have cost lives...innocent lives! Families would have been torn apart, including my own. And my name would have gone down in infamy! No way was I going to ruin my own life over those creeps!<br><br>And another thing: I would have been making my bullies the victims! That's right! Anytime a person brings a gun to school because they're being bullied...they automatically make their BULLIES the victims and only confirm what a few others thought of them all along! Bullies have been baiting victims, running their names in the ground and then using the victim's reactions to the torment to feign victim-hood for so long! So why do something stupid and make it TRUE...that they ARE heroes/martyrs and you really ARE a despicable person? <br><br>Don't give them the satisfaction! Work on ways to better yourself and always...ALWAYS love yourself and know your own worth! I not only survived the torment, I won over it. Today, I'm no longer a victim! I'm a VICTOR!<br><br>I tell my story of survival and triumph here:<br><br>*mod edit*
