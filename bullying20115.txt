				I'm sorry to hear about your story re: bullying.  Bullying has affected so many people around me over the last decade and I wish it would stop.  Though sadly I think it is an issue which will be around for a long time.  What do you think are the major issues around it?  Are schools doing enough to combat this issue? Are there enough preventative measures in place to protect students within school environments?  I'd be interested to get your viewpoints on this issue??
