It really would have been a huge prpblem to switch and I just didn't want to make me/my family go through the trouble of switching. I have moved back to the US recently and feel better because I'm reattending a public school where I am not mistreated. However the teachers found it outrageous that I wouldn't befriend my bullies and tried to force me to speak with a guidance counselor, is this normal behavior? Considering they knew about the bullying and didn't discourage it.<br>I think it's wonderful that the student found a safer way to express their intelligence. <br>This school still affects me so I put up a kind of sweet, dumb, self absorbed facade even though I secretly hate myself it's like they'll never really find out how stupid I feel. Is this normal behavior? Its the only way I can really function, I feel.</div></blockquote><br><br><br>I was bullied at school, too. Or rather they tried. This was mostly because I was years ahead of my peers in terms of intelligence. My father and grandfather both being scientists, by the time I was eleven I'd read Darwin, Hawking, Einstein and knew more about Physics, Biology, Politics and Human Behavioural Science than my teachers, which was a cause for concern.<br><br>I was often called 'weird' or 'freak' or whatever because I was in classes of children 4-5 years older than me, yet still more 'intelligent' than them. The difference is, though, that I didn't <span style="font-style: italic">believe</span> them. I didn't agree with them. And because I chose not to believe them, their words had no effect on me. <br><br>When you believe and agree with people that you're stupid, you begin to feel stupid, and when you feel stupid you are more likely to do stupid things. But like I said, there is no such thing as a stupid person. There is <span style="font-style: italic">always</span> something you can be good at, and always something you can succeed at. You may not have found it yet, but it sounds like you're still kinda young, and despite being quite clever, I didn't discover my passion for Euthenics and Human Behavioural Science until I was 20 (I am 31 now). <br><br>When people accuse you of being stupid/a freak/whatever, they're invariably projecting their own insecurities and anxieties. It says much more about them than it does you, in fact. Bullies always tend to have some sort of deprivation in their life: with rich kids, it tends to be parental deprivation, with working class kids, it tends to be social deprivation, etc. <br><br>My advice is to try things. Try everything. Find out what you enjoy, what you're good at, and succeed at it. The more things you enjoy doing, the less effect people's opinions will have on you, because you'll know yourself much better - you'll have a much higher self-image.<br><br>And if you can, read Stephen Hawking's Biography. I usually recommend it to people with anxiety and depression because his life story is such a success story. He is a person who found meaning in life by finding something he loved and succeeding at it and, just by doing this, beat all the odds, and continues to do so. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile">
