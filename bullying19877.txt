				I'm pretty much over the situation... but the main thing is getting to me is the victimization of it... everyone has a nose, and its just a reminder, or even if I just take a look at it, I wonder why am I even looking then I remember. I even sometimes think if peoples noses are even broken,  Maybe I just need to get my nose fixed, the doctor says its only a deviated septum, that I should wait a year and maybe it would fix itself.
