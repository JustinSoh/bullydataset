				I'm assuming that you're white based on your post.. <br>Do you think that your experience might be different to that of the average white person though?<br><br>You say that you were always scared..   I don't think that most white people would always be scared  - why do you think you were?<br>You said that no-one ever yelled or screamed at you..   <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br><br><br><br>I like being white.. (well..  kind of browny pinky really but classified as white/caucasian) <br>I'm not really seeing any downsides to it.. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br>I like our fairy tales..   the traditional versions are quite dark really but all countries and cultures have their own dark stories..   <br>from the Baba Yaga of Slavic origin, to little Red Riding Hood (first told apparently in the 10th century in France..  google says so anyway)..   fairy tales have always had a lesson to learn wrapped up in them and it usually means something like ''listen to your elders or disasters will happen''.. or ''tell the truth and be kind or disasters will happen''..   <br>Pretty grim i guess but meh.. i like trying to see the positives in things and i loved fairy tales as a child - i had a big book of Grimms Fairy tales..  my favourite book once (:
