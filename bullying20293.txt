				Deflect her comments in a casual, self-assured manner.   Don't get defensive (that would just play into her hands) - but when she says "How did you get such a good score?",  reply with   "As you know, in grades 11 and 12 I studied very hard and excelled in my schoolwork.   I'm sure my good score reflects those efforts.   Thanks for asking."   And give her a big smile when you say that.   (not snarky, just a nice smile, as though she was sincerely interested in your academic career.)<br><br>Response to comment about your siblings writing your reports -  say "It was so helpful to have my siblings proofread my reports my first semester of college, but of course I wrote them myself and after the first semester I had enough experience I no longer needed them to proof my reports.   Perhaps if your daughter gets someone to proof her work for a few months it could help her, too."    Again, accompany this with a big smile, as you certainly want your little cousin to succeed in school.  <br><br>Response to hypochondriac question -- "Gosh, Auntie Sue, you know I have always done well in the language arts.   I remember my spelling classes in fourth grade - we not only had to know how to spell the word, but know what it meant and use it in a sentence.   I have found that all-encoompassing approach to language arts to be very helpful, even in my engineering classes."   Again, big big smile.<br><br>As for the gossip that you have a learning disability, I would probably hit her right between the eyes on that one.   I would take her aside and say directly, "Aunt Sue, Cousin Amy tells me that you told her that I have a learning disability.   All kids go through challenging periods in life, often in junior high, but I was never diagnosed with a learning disability.  I would appreciate you not spreading falsehoods."    No smile on this one, just a stern look as you gaze directly into her eyes.   <br><br>I don't think she will stop unless she is called on her behavior.   The minor stuff, you laugh off and casually put her in her place.   The mean gossip like the learning disability stuff, look her right in the eye and let her have it.  Calmly, not defensively.   <br><br>Congrats on your engineering studies.   I hope learn to drive a stick shift car and operate the TV remote control someday.   My hat is off to you.   Good luck
