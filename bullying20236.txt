				In my family that is. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"> For the record my entire immediately family has been extremely abusive to me my whole life and in fact caused me to split and dissociate. :/ I'm now living with my aunt, who's also proving to be emotionally abusive and toxic. -sighs-<br><br>Anyways. This concerns my sister's boyfriend. She's 21 and he's 30. He's an ex-Marine. I have never liked him. He's very blunt to the point of being actually cruel, but he passes it off as "sarcasm." <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"> And never apologizes for his actions. He used to call me "special needs" all the time. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused"> Why? I liked a Hello Kitty candy in the store. Yeah, seriously.<br><br>I lived with my sister and him for almost two weeks right after I got out of school, and it was a nightmare. He told me that I should find my sister hot and want to go d*wn on her. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral"> WTF? Yeah that would be when I moved out immediately.<br><br>Anyway. He hates my aunt. She went down to AL a few weeks ago to get her mom's things. She had a code phrase in case something went very wrong [things were...bad down there].<br><br>I ended up telling my sister that I had given our aunt her phone number in case of an emergency during this trip. [FTR, my sister hates my aunt, as well.]<br><br>D. her boyfriend FREAKED OUT on me. He FB messaged me and basically ranted like how dare I give out HIS number [it's a family plan]. Just bitched constantly, and threatened to come over here and talk to me face to face and he'd block my number if I DARED *ever* do that again. I was like... <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> Dude, whatever. Fine. And blocked him on FB 'cause who needs to listen to that sh*t?<br><br>He resorted to text messaging me more threats. He threatened to out me as bi to my parents. [They're...very religious and homophobic.] And he threatened to punch me in the mouth and told me to shut up and "stop dressing like a freak in the circus." He was so abrasive and threatening, he actually scared our external protector. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> And she is BRAVE, she doesn't take sh*t from people. That's how threatening and harassing he was. We actually called the police, and they warned him that if he ever texted/called/messaged me again, I could get him cited for harassment.<br><br>....Ok. My aunt doesn't like him either, she thinks he's a d*ck, but ever since she's got back from AL, she keeps wanting me to "make up" with my sister, no matter how many times I tell her that I didn't really HAVE a problem with my sister, it was D. :/<br><br>And then tonight. She had someone come up with a u-haul of some of her stuff from AL and needed to get it moved into a storage unit. I told her repeatedly I wanted to help, I would love to help YES I'll help...but I will not be in the same place if D. is gonna be there. Flat-out...no way.<br><br>Yeah, guess who ended up driving the u-haul? <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes"> I stuck to my guns and said no, I will not go if he's there. And I've also said that it's NOT just antipathy, we have panic attacks at the thought of being around him and he makes all our ptsd stuff flare up, the over-arousal, hyper-alertness...basically being around him would leave me "tweaked" to the max for days. Not to mention what it would do inside to our little alters etc.<br><br>My aunt and mom comes back, and all I get is guilt tripping tonight. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"> That I'm "lucky she loves me." That I need to be a big girl and "learn how to get along with people I don't like." Constant guilt, constant badgering, why couldn't I be there for them, acting like I'm a horrible disappointment. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic">The man threatened repeatedly to physically harm me.</span> <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"> My aunt kept acting like oh well if he did anything, your mom and I would be there. Yeah f**king right. My mom's the one who has in the past ACTIVELY TAKEN THE SIDE AGAINST ME when I'm being harassed. Yeah. Not just not supported me. HARANGUED ME *WITH* the people harassing me. I'm supposed to feel better that she's there?! And my aunt's the one who acted like it was no big deal at all when I told her my dad would spank me with his belt so hard I'd bruise for a week. If she sees "no big deal, forgive him" in THAT, WTF does D. get to do to me?! <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked"><br><br>But no apparently I can't just act like an adult... <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"> :/ Should I have gone and gotten verbally bullied then? He also had email conversations with my boyfriend, in which he ripped every single aspect of my character, personality, and life into utter shreds, decrying how much he hates every single aspect of who I am. I'm supposed to subject myself to this person? Why?<br><br>Why can't my family EVER accept that sometimes it's -wrong- to go back to someone who's HURT you?! <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad">
