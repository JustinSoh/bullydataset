				When bullying is considered to be a deliberate act of violence, then yes, you are right to think so. However, bullying among school children only occurs within a certain age group. It concerns children from 8 up to 15 years of age. This applies to children from all over the world, the rich, the poor, the big and the small. Because of that, bullying must be caused by the development of our brain. It affects approximately 20% of the children. Half of them will be targets.<br>At age 10 a child will become independent from parental guidance. It considers itself to be superior to others, even to the teacher and the school board. Rules on behaviour are therefore ignored. On criticism they now respond 'cool' keeping themself under control. They lie, deny and blame others to protect themselves. That is why this stage is called the Self Protective Stage. These children can become bullies.<br>The target is a child that still relies upon protection by adults. The dont like to be alone and they tend to hide behind a parent. They do not report being bullied because they are convinced that the adults will see and protect by intervening. Reporting bullying then is seen as an act of mistrust.<br>Bullies will show of their superiority by mistreating a child, in front of their friends only. Within one group of school children both of them may be present. As more children will enter the Selfprotective Stage the number of bullies will grow leaving the target without friends. As a result of that the child will suffer from an unbalanced psychological development towards adulthood. This stress may lead to extreem violence towards themselves or others (except towards the bullies).<br><br>Bullies reject authority, but not parental authority. That makes ending bullying very simpel. All you need to do is to force the bully to tell mum/dad about him/her being a bully. By telling the parent that bullying is an unlawfull act wich will cause damage for wich they are accountable, will make sure the bullying is stopped immedately. <span style="font-style: italic">*mod edit*</span><br><br>Now you know why so many anti-bullying programs are useless. It all comes down to one thing and that is: If my child is mistreating your child, then why do you want school to solve that instead of me, the responsable parent?
