It is the <span style="text-decoration: underline">experience</span> of bullying that is important.  <br><br>As an example of what I mean, in the 70s and 80s I did a lot of backpacking to remote parts of the world, frequently where there were few, if any, other tourists.  I experienced various privations such as extreme hunger and exhaustion and often found myself in circumstances which most people would find extremely intimidating.  But I had to deal with those situations.  Thousands of miles away from help or home there was no option!  But on my return from such trips, my confidence had grown to such an extent that I felt I could pretty much take on the world! Those backpacking holidays were no picnic, the more difficult the better as far as I was concerned, and that was because I knew how much good they were doing me.  They taught me many things, not least of which was how to deal with life and how to look after myself.  The point is, I didn’t wrap myself up in cotton wool. Instead I got out there and got some <span style="text-decoration: underline">life experience</span>.  And to this day, when ever I feel myself being intimidated by my boss at work, for example, I’ll deliberately put myself into situations that frighten me (or at the very least make me feel uncomfortable) the result being that my confidence grows and I no longer feel intimidated.  Therefore I know from personal experience that wrapping children up in cotton wool – the modern appraoch to child welfare – doesn’t work.  What <span style="text-decoration: underline">does </span>work is putting oneself into uncomfortable or difficult situations - of stretching the boundaries of that comfort zone.  It is those experiences which make one stronger.<br><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Chucky wrote:</cite>In a case recently here in Ireland, a girl was bullied for her good looks and she ended-up killing herself.

<br>As to those victims of bullying that you mention, well, I’m sorry, but I don’t buy that.  These children died not because they were bullied but, I suspect, because they couldn’t cope with life.  In other words their inability to cope with bullying was a merely a symptom of a much more fundamental problem or ‘disease’. Therefore in order to treat the ‘disease’, to teach children how to cope with life, the ‘prescription’ is for them to be allowed to get some life experience.  That simply isn’t being allowed in today’s society and at some point in the future, if it isn’t happening already, they will suffer the consequences of society's neglect, just like those two children you mention above.
