				If ever I thought meditation was appropriate and might help, this is it. You didn't do something monstrous or so very unusual, but you did do something unkind. That's proof you're human, frankly. But it is hard when one's self-image is damaged, by oneself or by others. Assuming you are a teenager, I don't think teenagers are the best at forgiveness - everything seems way too monumental when you're a teen and it's easy to nurse grudges. You apologies which is realistically all you can do. Hopefully your friend will come to an understanding of why you said what you said. But you may have to live with the possibility that she won't.<br><br>So, I think the best way to restore your sense of yourself as a good person is to be kind, careful and considerate with others on a daily basis and maybe keep a little notebook or diary of those nice things you have said and done. You'll see how quickly they add up. If you can spare half-a-day every fortnight maybe you could do some voluntary work if you don't do already?<br><br>Otherwise, I'd really suggest mindfulness as a way of sitting with this feelings and helping you be a bit kinder to yourself. There are loads of good books available. Barry Long's <span style="font-style: italic">Meditation: A Foundation Course</span> is a classic for a good reason (<span style="font-style: italic">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Meditation-Foundation-Course-Book-Lessons/dp/1899324003/</span>) and if you wanted something that focuses more specifically on mindfulness meditation there are many resources free online, such as: <a href="https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/" class="postlink" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank';">https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/</a><br><br>I hope this helps a little <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"> If you can try to be patient. This takes time. But you can start to feel better, I promise.
