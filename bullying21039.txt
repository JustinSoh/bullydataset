				Oh BluejayBruise, your story was heartbreaking and I'm crying real tears when thinking about what you have had to experience  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad"> <br><br>There must be something wonderful in you, otherwise this wouldn't have happened to you. But it's so wrong and so unfair  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad"> <br><br>Why is it that people have the need to throw dirt on something beautiful, as if trying to hide it and make others think in the same sick way?!<br><br>Worst was reading how teachers sided with the abusers. It only shows that even adults can be the biggest cowards. However what is worst was that they were supposed to protect you, in fact their duty was to protect you and also do it in public! <br><br>Nobody apologising to you is a thing that makes it even harder to forget, in addition to all the lies being spread about you, you being singled out and isolated (ARGH!!!) and had I heard your story earlier, then I would have immediately reported the teachers on your behalf!  <br><br>It wouldn't have been the first time, I am not afraid of speaking up for the victims. When my son was bullied in school and the teacher didn't do a thing about it, I waited to the next meeting with all parents and spoke directly to them, asked them to ask their children if they had bullied my son. I also told about another boy in the class, about how he was bullied and insulted on a daily basis as someone who is stupid and smells bad etc. etc. His parents also spoke up after that, they had talked to the teacher many times but the teacher didn't do a thing.<br><br>The bullies didn't admit it to their parents, but one girl stood up in the classroom the next day and named the bullies in front of the teacher and the teacher couldn't ignore it anymore.<br><br>After that a new rule was made: if the bully didn't stop, then they would report it to the police and the bully would be suspended from the school. That was effective since what teachers don't understand is that bullies don't have any boundaries, they go forward until they are stopped by someone who has authority - so you my friend, you were really abandoned and neglected and the freaking bullies became 'victims' the minute they were accused! <br><br>I wish that we would all teach our children to stand up for the victim. My son was quickly back to himself after the bullying stopped and he was famous of always going in between every situation and taking the victim under his wings. And there are so many children out there with broken wings  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad"> <br><br>Everyone please step in everytime you witness someone being bullied, if you are adults and witness something on the playground, then go straight to the bully instead of his parents. The bullies are cowards and you don't have to do anything more than tell him to stop it and threathen to tell his parents if he doesn't. It works <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br><br>Wish there was something I could do for you, BluejayBruise... <br><br>Everyone who stood by or bullied you will pay for it sooner or later. Everyone. Life is wonderful because it's so just and fair. If you can think that they will have to pay for it one day, maybe your wounds start to heal faster. You don't have to worry over it, nature takes care of these things and nobody gets away. Nobody.<br><br>Is there a possibility of you 'starting all over'? You have so much to give to the world due to your suffering, that if you could just walk away from it all and concentrate on something positive instead, then it could change your life and you could finally start to feel happy and feel good about yourself. Because you are good, always remember that!<br><br>I follow this 'rule' that Dalai Lama once said:<br><br>What you concentrate on grows bigger. So why not concentrate on something positive?<br><br>It really works, sooner or later you will find many positive things in your life. Good things just start walking in your life and all you have to do is embrace them. <br><br>Hopefully you can start to turn everything around, all the nasty things said about you - they are NOT you - nobody has the right to define you except you yourself. If they say that you are stupid, then it means that you are smart etc. You have to believe in it. It might take some time but it starts to work. Tomorrow is built on this day, so please make it the best <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br><br>I feel your pain and am so damn angry that <span style="text-decoration: underline">nobody</span> stepped in and stopped it! That's a crime!<br><br>All the best to you and take care, you are not alone. All victims feel for you and care for you, you just have to find them <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink"><br><br>-- Mon Jun 18, 2012 1:27 pm --<br><br>Oh and one other thing: People with dyslexia are more intelligent than others. It's not a sign of stupidity anymore, it's a sign of intelligence <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink">
