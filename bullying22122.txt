Some kids just pick on anyone who is different in any way.  You're right, there will always be people making fun of others who are different.  Thanks but I guess there will always be a part of me that will be ashamed for not standing up for myself.  I hadn't been in a fight before either.  I wish I was because one kid kept challenging me.  One time he mocked me and challenged me right on my front stoop.  Instead of accepting and standing up for myself I ran inside to my mother.  My mother berated me so badly for being such a coward.  I know I totally deserved it.  I know how ashamed she must have been to have such a coward for a son.  I cried for almost an hour.  It was my fault.  If I had just stood up for myself instead of running.  Tat's why I mean I was a coward.  I wish I could go back and change things but I can't.
