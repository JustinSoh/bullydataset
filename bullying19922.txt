				No. Please don't apologize. Your opinion is not one to be apologized for. We don't have to agree!!! You are very much entitled to how you feel. I do respect that. I should go back and reread what I wrote...I didn't mean to make you feel bad...also realize that often I start out talking "to" someone but then as I go along...I usually use the term "you" as in general...not directed at any one person posting but more towards "society" ...an example...in general. 
<br>
<br>I can very much appreciate how you've come to feel as you do. I don't agree on some of what you said...but then you know what? I've never personally experienced something like this before. Now I'm a parent of a 6 1/2yr. old and 4yr. old little girls. I hope they never have to experience something like this and I know I'd not have a clue what to do if they were. My instinct would be to pull them out of school...but where do you go? How do you ensure the same won't happen at another school or another town? It's been known to travel w/ you! 
<br>
<br>So I have some limited thoughts on the subject and I voiced that...but I don't have personal experience. You have every right to post how you feel. And in a forum such as this...it's very common for people to post from their emotion before thinking thorugh everything. So again....don't apologize for your opinion. IT wasn't like it was so extreme or negative or what have you...you shouldn't feel a need to apologize for how you feel. 
<br>
<br>By the way...welcome to the boards and I'm glad you are talking here w/ others.
