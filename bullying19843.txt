				i think some of the advice in the original post i misguided. asking the bully to stop will only convey the message that the bully is achieving his goal. if the "bullying" comes from your childs friend, then explaining that their comments are hurtful and asking them to please stop or the friendship will cease, will work, but otherwise i think it's exteremly counter-productive. <br><br>getting your child to understand that the remarks are a projection of the bullies own self hatred will be hard but that is the first step that needs to be achieved. after achieving this, agreeing with the bully is a great stratergy for steering the bully away onto more rewarding targets, but it's not going to stop the bully from bullying others. <br><br>i agree that violence should not be advocated, but as parents you could arm your children with words to throw back at the bully. get your kid to point out the child, take a good look at him and their parents, then come up with, or scour the internet for something good for your child to obliterate the bully publically. <br><br>i think it's better than your child defends him/herself so as to save him/her from selfesteem and confidence issues later in life. a few detentions and poor disciplinary record at school is history after you move school, and it's nothing compared to the lifelong damage the sustained bullying could cause your child.
