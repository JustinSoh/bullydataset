				Your 'friend' sounds very childish.  You do not have to physically fight to stand up for your family that immature.<br><br>Rise above it, tell him you do not fight and have no interest in such a thing.  You are a responsible adult with a child on the way, (not to mention a possible heart problem) infantile play ground scraps should not be on the agenda.  You have more important things to worry about, and so should he have as he has got a young baby.<br><br>If he wants to spar he can go to a gym.  What's with this guy?<br><br>He's no friend.  I don't like him!<br><br>As for facebook, don't post on it, or make it clear you do not fight and unless he is respectful you will block him.   That's brave.<br>If he persists in harassing, or if he is threatening tell the police.  My he sounds like a pain in the a##e.
