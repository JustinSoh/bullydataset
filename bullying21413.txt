				Pranks can be seen as a form of bullying, SL2002, but from what you right in your post regarding the pranks played on boys at the camp, it sounds a bit like an initiation ceremony, where the boys that take the pranks better become accepted as part of the group, and the boys that complain or fail, don't become accepted by the group.  It is bullying, and can do a lot of psychological damage.
