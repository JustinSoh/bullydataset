				Hello, I am 12 years old, and im being harassed at school. As well as being bullied (Being called names, pushed, kicked punched etc...) Im also having a lot of peer presure for things like make-up , which I had no former plans to wear. This may sound small, but if you knew me you would no that make-up just wasnt me! I have started thinking im ugly, and wearing more and more. I have gotten so many spots from the foundation! Also, the name calling consists of things like sl*g    sl*t     ske*t and things like this. I dont want to carry on and on but if you have any comments please do !
