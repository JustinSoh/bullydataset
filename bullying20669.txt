And so to me....when I talk about my age....I do mean to speak of my life experience.....does that make sense? LIke I might say "well back in my 20s I did such and such" and talk about a certain event ....I'm having a hard time explaining.....at any rate....I do agree w/ your point. I've heard this point made before and it's definetly a very good one. Especially agree w/ you....I too have come across many children that seem more mature then some adults I've run into.   <br><br>But still....I wouldn't want MARS to look at her age for where she is now and get hung up on a number. I wanted her to appreciate her life for what she has <span style="font-style: italic">attained within it</span>. Thank you for correcting me that what she has gained isn't about just the number of years ...but her<span style="font-style: italic"> life experience</span>...be it 20 years...30 years...or 60 years....I want her to see the beauty and quality of the years she has spent here!</div></blockquote>

<br>I wasnt correcting you, i was expressing my opinion on that age dosent equate to maturity or wisdom on a general scale. It's open for debate.
<br>
<br>People get hung up on numbers....its normal and a part of life. I wouldnt think she'd wallow on her age to the point of forgetting what her life and efforts have amassed. None the less she seem's to have a good head on her shoulders and probably already know this.
<br>
<br>Ironicly "life experience" dosent mature a person but rather depleats them as a human being . Conditions them to order, rules and restrictions. Drowns there primative zest.
<br>
<br>What matures a person is to suffer. When you suffer you learn, when you learn you grow, growth is progress through understanding. And when you understand you are mature. This tends to happen to most people, some it takes 40 years, others 30, 20 ect. Depends on the amount of your suffering.
<br>
<br>Well off topic but this just occured to me as i was writing it.
