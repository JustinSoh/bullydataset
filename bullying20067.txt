				I grew up in New York and I have similar experiences. In junior high school, everyone was constantly making extremely vulgar jokes about sex, sodomy, homosexuality, etc. Depending on where you lived, I would not be surprised that they were making fun of your chipmunks. Tweens these days are really sick in the head. <br><br>I was also very self-conscious when I was in junior high. It came to the point that my limbs seized up whenever I was around anyone. I suppose it's nature.
