				Hi there. I'm not going to tell my own story here. I just  want to share an email which i received before. It is written to all the people who are facing social problems or bullied. I find it quite useful for my situation. So maybe some of you here may find it useful too <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br><br>I post this letter on the bully forum, social phobia forum and avoidant personality disorder forum too, so that it may reach more "social outcast". If it is not allowed, administrators please kindly help me to delete the post in social phobia forum and avoidant personality disorder forum.<br><br><br><br><span style="color: #000080">Dear reader,<br><br>We don't know each other, but I've always been wishing to write to you. English is not my native language. So please be forgiving to my writing. This letter is dedicated to everyone who is suffering from the pain of being a social outcast. I know that pain because I was an outcast too. By giving you some little advice and suggestions here, I hope I'll be able to make your life easier.<br><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>The most important point</span><br><br>If you've seek advice elsewhere before, you must have heard many saying "Be yourself". You may doubt these two words, but you'd better take this advice. Being unpopular and always isolated by peers, we often believe we must have many problems with ourselves. I thought this way before too. But come to think about it, who is flawless? Who has no weakness? No one! And trust me, you don't have more flaws than anyone else. The reason why others mistreat you is not necessarily because they are bothered by your flaws, but is more likely because they envy your strength, which they don't possess and have no way to get.<br><br>Improving upon our weaknesses is a good thing, but to change who you are is definitely not. My friend, I know how hard it is to be yourself in these hard days. However, believe me, giving up your own traits will not be a smart policy. Only if you strive to be yourself, your situation can have a hope to be improved.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">The next step: How to take revenge</span><br><br>The title here should actually be "Do good to your haters". But I know so well if I make it that way, you'll skip the whole session and miss another very important point.<br><br>Yes I know you are not interested in becoming a saint. Me too. The "do good to your haters" I'm going to write about has nothing to do with moral education. It is all about helping you end your hardship quicker. Before you doubt me, please trust me, it can work wonders for you. I've never dreamed that among the people who were still teasing me, spreading rumour about me and isolating me several months ago, now four of them have become my friends (not very intimate, but still to the point that we will chat together and sometimes text each other on mobile phone). One of those four was the "leader" of those who bullied me.<br><br>I seem to hear you saying "unbelievable". Yes, it is unbelievable. But it just happened that way and it happened to me, so I've no choice but to believe it. I've no need to lie or exaggerate the fact. After all, I won't get any benefits in doing so. Every word I wrote in this letter serves just one purpose: to ease you pain. Because I know how painful it can be as a social outcast.<br><br>Now I should explain how I used that five words to get my result. It requires some skills. But don't worry. They are easy.<br><br>First of all, don't forget (I don't think you will) that they are the bullies and you are the victim. Bullies will never expect their victim to go good to them voluntarily. So when you start doing that, they will certainly be surprised (even if they don't seem surprised). And some very small good deeds are already enough to freak them out. Surprising people in a positive way is the very first step to make anyone change their mind about you. Remember this because it can be useful for you even in other aspects of life.<br><br>When you start doing good to them, some of them may make fun of you. That should be expected. But believe me, it will just happen for a very short while. After that, your situation will be much improved. Don't worry doing good to your bullies will make you look stupid or increase your troubles. It won't. You should know the truth that no one in the world dislike or reject anything or anyone that brings them benefits. When you do something nice for those who mistreat you, or when you even manage to solve their urgent need, they may still seem unmoved or use harsh words against you. But they will certainly start to like you from their hearts and feel embarrassed for what they have done to you.<br><br>I mentioned "very small good deeds" before. Yes, the good deeds don't need to be big and obvious. In fact, I don't suggest being overly kind to your bullies. It can look odd. What you can do for them can be, say, picking up their stationery for them when they drop them accidentally, lending them something they need, or complementing their clothing or hair style, etc.(the last one is the most effective, but try to be sincere!) They are not so hard to do and cost you nothing, but they can work wonders for you.<br><br>The last point to remind you: do not take revenge. I understand you may be resentful. It is totally normal and you have a good reason to feel that way. But we can never win by taking revenge in any form. Because they have many people while you're only on your own. It is dangerous and you should not and have no need to risk worsening your situation.  My experience taught me that the perfect revenge is making bullies feel guilty and ashamed of what they have done to me from the bottom of their hearts! Now you know, this perfect revenge can only be achieved through using that five-word strategy. Even if those five words cannot turn your enemies into friends like in my case, I promise it will certainly reduce their hostility towards you. Try them out tomorrow and see what wonders they will work for you!<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">The story of a two-cent coin</span><br><br>I understand how painful and unbearable this period of hardship can be. I know you feel like it is endless. But believe me, it just seems like will never end, but it actually will end. Don't worry.<br><br>During the period I was bullied, I always brought along with myself a two-cent coin everyday i went to school. I put it in the pocket of my school dress (Yes I'm a girl, now you know). Comparing with many other objects, a two-cent coin is very tiny. But when you put it very near to your eye and look out, you will find that a tiny coin can cover more than half of your vision. That's why I brought a little coin with me every day - to remind myself my hardship was actually not as overwhelming as it seems. I thought it was that serious just because I was in the midst of it. And when the whole thing is over and becomes your history (we know it will), it will be much less horrible when we recall it.<br><br>You may also choose a tiny object to bring with you every day to remind youself of this little truth, and to bring yourself strength and hope.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">My curse, Your blessing</span><br><br>No one wants to be an outcast. No matter how positive and "sunshine" I sound, my days were very painful too. Before I was bullied, I was already suffering from depression. You can imagine, after the bullying began, my emotional problem became much more severe. I had suicidal thoughts for uncountable times. However, if experiencing bullying and isolation were my curses, I wish through this letter they can now be turned into blessings for you. Honestly, I don't know if this letter is helpful at all. But even if you only find one single sentence inspiring and helpful, I think it is worth writing it.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold">Don't stop</span><br><br>I know how much you hate your current situation. But trust me, it is not necessarily a no-good situation. I hope you can make use of all the advantages this period of hardship brings you. Do you have any subject you are particularly interested in? Or some other special talents? Try to keep on building upon them. No any? Impossible. Try some new activities that you dare not do before, and you will be surprised by your potentials! Remember, a social outcast is not a person with no value, but it is just that our values are not yet recognized by others. We can still shine in our own ways. Not having a large flock of friends means we have plenty of time to explore ourselves and develop our strength. This is truly our advantage. You'd better not disregard it.<br><span style="font-weight: bold"><br>The last challenge</span><br><br>The last challenge is simple but can be uneasy: staying happy. When you feel happy, let yourself be happy. This is not bullsh*t. Many socially isolated people, like me before, often feel depressed and melancholy all day long, even when their bullies are not near them. My good news for you is we don't need to be like that. I strongly discourage you to place any extra emotional burden on yourself. Life is already stressful enough for us, so don't miss any single chance to feel relax and comfortable. No matter you love music or sports, reading or outing, do more the things you love and things that bring you joy. (It doesn't matter if you need to do them alone.) In this way, you will find although you are facing a big problem, your life is still enjoyable. It is not all dark.<br><br><br>Before saying goodbye, I just want to remind you: don't live your life resentfully. The fact that some people mistreat us does not mean everyone is evil. There are still nice people and good things in this world. And you will meet them, believe me. <br><br>Also, even if others tell you that you are worthless, don't listen to them. You still have your own values. You still have something to give to this world. You can offer help to other unfortunate people too. Don't forget, in the world there are many people living a life ten times more tragic and unbearable than yours and mine. Maybe you can do something for them.<br><br> <br>Best wishes,<br>The one who cares<br><br>P.s. Feel free to forward this letter to anyone you think they may need this. Thanks!</span>
