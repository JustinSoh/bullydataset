				Interesting. I never felt sick when I saw or heard about my bullies, i didn't even panic. I just felt rage, hate, and I wanted to torture them. Maybe one day I even have the chance. The only thing they destroyed inside me is the trust in others, and my empathy. I don't give a damn about others, and they feelings. I'm like a good actor. I manipulate people to reach my own goals, and most of the times they even don't notice it. And i even like to see others fail, or being hurt. Its such a good feeling!
