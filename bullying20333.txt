				Hello... that is my first post on this truly magnificent forum. Please excuse me for any possible grammar errors or spelling mistakes, English is not my native language.<br><br>I'm by nature a little crazy. Many people told me that - but I was living pretty good life until the last year.<br><br>First of all, my father left us. Then my sister left us for short amount of time. Then I got limerent (that's like romantic OCD) over a girl. Then I got extra pressure to do well in school (my perfomance dropped a little, but it's not something really bad. I'm still A grade student, which is however irrelevant to my short story!)<br><br>I was fine with these, although it is not very funny to deal with. I was always little asocial, always clumsy, always an outsider - people at school don't like me much until they need help or something.<br><br><br>Then... the bullying started. I don't even remember how it began - but for 2 or 3 weeks I was down. I had a lot of fights before, but this time it was worse, because I didn't know who to fight. Like the whole class bullied me - verbally, emotionally, in some cases physically. I thought it is going to stop if I keep silent. It didn't. Then, I started attacking them too. I had fights with several bullies, it didn't work... until the past week when I finally kicked one of the bully's ass.<br><br>It stopped. My anger, irritability and frustration didn't. What I fear more is that, I want revenge so bad. I find myself daydreaming about killing them. I dream at night about killing them. I want to kill them. Some times, I want to kill myself and I have suicide thoughts, but I'm not going to do that - I'm not a fool.<br><br>At night it gets worse - I get anger outbreaks, so I listen to aggressive music - which makes me even more aggressive. I even thought of bullying them or embarrassing them in public. Which is not good.<br><br>Am I turning into a psychopath? I don't feel empathy towards them anymore, I feel empathy only towards my family members AND animals AND inanimate objects (I'm kind of crazy, right?)<br><br>What do I do? Telling my parents is not an option, school counselors aren't an option and psychologists aren't option either.
