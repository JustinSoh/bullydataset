				i'm sorry  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br><br>sounds like it's likely to be a side effect of trauma -  we can often sink quite far into distress when we've been through a traumatic experience and that can take the form of re-experiencing things and re-imagining ..   which is what it sounds like is probably happening for you.<br><br>The only way of stopping it really is time and healing -   therapy can be really useful.. most especially CBT or EMDR (as far as i've heard from others anyway - both therapy types have had really good results when used for traumatic experiences)<br>is therapy something that you'd consider and be able to try?   <br>How long since you left high school and the bullying stopped?<br><br>xx
