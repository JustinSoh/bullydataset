				I was bullied as a child, but after reading a lot of the topics on this website, I can see that it seems to be a pretty common thing. <br><br>What bothers me are adults who bully people. I used to go on a lot of websites to let people know not to watch movies that were racist towards my ethnicity. People on most of those sites wrote back just to make fun of my race. The sad thing is, I think most of these people were adults in their 20s. They were just cracking really immature and racist jokes like they were in junior high school. <br><br>I wonder if they're brave enough to do that in real life. <br><br>I wonder what drives people to do these sorts of things.
