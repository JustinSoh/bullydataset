Sorry, it was not my intention to encroach upon that with my relatively insignificant problem compared to a child being bullied.<br><br>Can anyone suggest a better place to post - or perhaps the Mods will move this for me and advise me?? Thanks.<br></span></span><br><br><br>Sorry I find it hard to be concise so for those that read all then Thank You very much.<br><br>I have just experienced some bullying -- building over the last couple of weeks and culminating two days ago.<br><br>I have already been in a state of mental collapse since about May and historically I intermittently suffer from a ruminative form of OCD and associated depression. No guesses why I'm the easy target then!!!<br><br>This recent event was in a social (but kinda potential work related) sphere.<br><br>Peak, two days ago, was a serious belittling of me in front of friends. One friend quite obviously being seen by the bully as ideal to influence against me.<br><br>I fell for it all at the time. Repeated criticisms of absolutely everything I said and any input I offered to conversation. Bully always claiming superior knowledge and suggesting I'm stupid. I made the probable mistake of trying to be friendly, recognise their knowledge and even ask their opinion!!! All of course used back against me.<br><br>The mutual friend that was unfortunately standing between us repeatedly started to complain about 'bickering'. I was very disappointed because it was very clear to me that this was one way traffic. (I since understand - see below).<br><br>I eventually left with the inadequate repost ''you are pathetic''.<br><br>----------------<br>Then - the pain.<br><br>i was torn between taking a very BIG jump! - or returning with a weapon to harm this person. Both very heavy things to say!! The first is not new and I have mechanisms to deal with it (too many friends and family would be hurt). The second simply isn't in my nature - never has been -- and would clearly equally harm me.<br><br>OCD amongst other things kicked in and I went into a really bad state back at home. Finally I found the answer!<br><br>I don't know why the obvious word came to mind but it did. I 'googled' ''belittled by <span style="font-weight: bold">inadequate</span> peer'' !<br><br>Answer --- BULLY. Found a website that explained very well and all the misconceptions. V good description of the way they operate.<br><br>Ok now I understand how they work and why and it really helped me. I won't bore you with all that info you already know.<br><br>----------------<br>Everything now made sense&gt;&gt;<br><br>--Someone else had been a target and why (to influence a business owner to steal their job)<br><br>--Who had received a quiet 'word' while i wasn't around? The mutual friend obviously! Bully latching onto things where I and mutual friend have had friendly discussions but disagree.<br><br>--Equally, highlighting areas where bully and mutual friend have interest - to exclude me. Directing conversation towards this.<br><br>--Bully has recently discovered that I am in a dire financial and health (physical as well as mental) situation. Guess what! So is the bully! - financially at least. Mutual friend is a potential source of support - and has helped me. Obviously a need to divide and conquer from bully perspective. Personally I ain't playin!!<br><br>-- and more - but don't wanna bore you.<br><br>----------------------<br><br>Now.<br><br>Well. with this initial understanding I've obviously calmed down and realise that the bully is indeed pathetic. I'd feel sorry for them if i wasn't so angry.<br><br>My action so far has been merely to remove myself. Remove the bullying opportunity and prevent the risks to my health. I'm kinda proud I even achieved that much.<br><br>Where to go now??<br>I have to return to see several other friends. I'm just unclear how to handle the bully this time. Basic plan is to ignore/blank but very politely - not interested in anything they have to say however derogatory. Be strong enough to remove myself from any situation even if I have to abandon friends who I would rather stay with --- yep - a 'walk away' kinda stance might be appreciated and seen as mature and sensible by my friends???<br><br>Then the mutual friend mentioned? Ok, I understand now from reading bullying info how people just don't want to get involved for various reasons. Fair enough because people miscontrue the definition and signs of bullying - but is that a friend then? One worth having I think but it transpired that he's already been influenced enough to make 'agreements' with the bully (on some work available that he knew i was available for). He also, notably, was embarrassed by this and hid it from me -- possibly realising a mistake and had been only talked into it??<br><br>--<br>I'm fairly confident with the first part. Not sure at all about the second.<br><br>-----------<br>sorry very long post.<br><br>I would just be very grateful of anyones' views on how I might deal with this situation to benefit of all basically.
