				Basically my dad is a bully. He is not happy unless he makes someone else i e me unhappy. The other day we had dinner and i put my plate in the sink he comes to wear im sat and says u could adjatate the plate a bit. Knowing that hes trying to prevoke a response i ignore him. He says can you hear me and goes off on one threatening to throw me out and hit me. Its not just this if you disagree with him hell raise his voice and shout he says its not him but it is and its not only me that thinks this. Its gotten to the point that i actually hate him for what hes done to me. Hell shout and get argumentive over the slightest things. I brought a box of chocolate before christmas which hed opened and started eating. I said ooo eat my chocolates. This point was like a red rag to a bull with him saying no you didnt well not saying shouting. He spends loads of his time on ebay. Theres one point i said theres no wonder your son doesnt like you his response i dont care. Im writing this for advice because he is a bully!
