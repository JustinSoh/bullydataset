<br> Hello
<br>
<br>I am a retired educator and I experienced the devasting effects of bullying as a young boy myself. Bullying is a behavior that no one really forgets. Sometimes when we are bullied we find it difficult to form new relationships because we don't feel safe around others. We never feel like we can trust anyone because we are very sensitive to what others may say to us. Try finding one good friend who you can talk to. Join a group that has people in it that have the same interest as you. Above all, talk about with someone. You might be surprised how many people may have actually experienced some of the same things.
