These two people dislike each other very much, but are/were my two closest friends. I have noticed growing up that Lady would say mean things behind my back but then pretend to be my friend. I have recently (after 13 years of friendship) separated myself from Lady because of tension and her marijuana use, and now my closest friend is Gentleman.<br><br>Gentleman is just complaining about how much he has to work when his roommate can't make rent. He's just venting.<br><br>My question is...when someone is using a passive aggressive attack...is this a good example? I mean this statement is defined by it's ability to be so subtle that if anyone even suggested that these posts were related...she could deny it. Even though, with the timing, the people who can make the connection know the real truth.<br><br>Is this how it is done...is this crap the reason why it has always hurt so bad to be her friend? She does this stuff all the time, but if I asked her to stop, she would just say she didn't mean it that way, or that she was just joking. <br><br>Please help!
