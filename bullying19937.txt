As you said yourself, it won't happen and things are different now, you just need to retrain your brain and your reactions/responses.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SAH_FOYO wrote:</cite>How do I stop caring about what others think and let my guard down a little?</div></blockquote><br>You can stop caring about others think, when you realise it really doesn't matter what others think. You can let your guard down when you realise your environment has changed, and that the bullying situation you were in before is completely unnatural to most people's outward experience.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SAH_FOYO wrote:</cite>How do I get over my irrational fear of being thought of as a fool and/or a weakling?</div></blockquote><br>It takes time, but you're an adult now, different environment and you can surround yourself with people that are different or more mature than the ones you used to have.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SAH_FOYO wrote:</cite>I've gotten through it so why should anybody else have it easier?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>SAH_FOYO wrote:</cite>I don't whine, so why should I listen to anyone else's whining?</div></blockquote><br><blockquote><div><cite>SAH_FOYO wrote:</cite>When I was bullied I sucked it up and I never complained, till I finally learned to stand up for myself. Why should I have thick skin and nobody else is required to?</div></blockquote><br><br>I recognize these as 'common' incorrect thinking by inappropriate self-comparison. Don't compare what you've experienced to what you think others have experienced, in fact never compare anything to yourself in that light. People like to whine and think they have it bad, the appropriate response is to be considerate and sympathetic so that they feel better, just as you try to hide your past, that explains the way you are, so others will hide their past, there is a reason for everything. <br>In case you're thinking other people don't deserve sympathy, somewhere out there while I write this, there are nameless unknown children starving and being tortured or much worse, that have a living hell, that will never end, and could only wish they had the lives that we had, and they will never get the chance to defend themselves. That should put things in perspective, but at the end of the day, everyone we meet deserves sympathy.<br>I have the same thoughts as you do, then I realise they are wrong, I still struggle with the empathy and sympathy, but from an outsider's perspective, if they thought the same way, then the other person is often the one who had it soft, is whining and oversensitive, which includes you and me.<br>It's an exercise in changing perspective and brain re-training, once you don't think this way you will feel more positively.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>SAH_FOYO wrote:</cite>I developed this stupid need to be a ######6 "alpha" all the time. Always the one that nobody can ###$ with.</div></blockquote><br>I think it's a transitional phase that comes after coming out of a harsh/bullying environment. I went through the same phase. It's like a movie-prison mentality. You think that if you show any signs of weakness, people will bully you again, so you think aggressively-defensively, behaving as you think you should behave to 'survive', perhaps asking yourself "what should a person do in this situation?" and the answer will be wrong because you're thinking with the movie-prison mentality, not with your own personality or how a normal person would think. Other people won't understand it or why you think/act that way at all, it's not necessary now and maybe never was. It's like responding to aggression with aggression, you will look the bad guy even though you think it's necessary, and wonder why you don't ignore it or respond with diplomacy.. because they don't have your prior feelings and experience.<br>The solution is to picture yourself without the prior experience and feelings, imagine yourself in a world without the constant threat you had before, how would you respond now? double-check your responses and feelings until they seem to be inline with the positive, everyday people. You will be on the path to becoming the 'nice-r' person that you want to see yourself as again.
