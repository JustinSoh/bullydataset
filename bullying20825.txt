				Worst case ever, it just worked out this way.<br><br>I mentioned in another post, 'socialising around me'. It gets worse.<br><br>Met some young angry tech nerd with a lot of problems. Hacking expert, connected with *everyone* I mentioned in a Live journal he hacked. I was older, by about 8 yrs or so. Had been in a mental hospital, in recovery from severe psychosis. I had weekly counselling for trauma.<br><br>I start studying, I've had a job for about 6-8 months by that point. This young guy fixated on me for ammunition. Needed drama. Blew up immature stuff he could find out about me, quoted insults and told everyone he met who knew me that I was a bitch.<br><br>Played on their sympathies. The worst types of people you can meet after coming out of a lot of psych trauma. The social side of it for me made it impossible for me to make friends and connect with people who didn't have preconceived ideas or judgements of me, that were petty. <br><br>They watched me from afar, and decided that I did that because of x y and z, and they brainwash people in your life into thinking you are what they think.<br><br>The hacking, plus the young angry guy seeking approval and acceptance amongst his peers, the mental health issues they have, it was a nightmare for me.<br><br>I was still mentally unwell when I was writing stuff he'd hacked. It contained homicidal ideations. He got truckers involved as well, they started following me around and playing games with me on the road. He socialised with drug addicts and hippies. <br><br>They thieved from me and went through my bins and networked with people I wrote about in my journals, people who had already given me a hard time and who I had to walk away from. <br><br>The end result, was that I lost a lot of trust and people who never had any prejudices against me would lose it if I'd contacted them. <br><br>A former colleague ended up brainwashing people into thinking I'd f$#@ed them up and that they 'deserved better'. The petty reframing reflected badly on me, because their agenda was to isolate me socially. That was their thing. The girl was a bully as well, she made other people feel like $#%^, I didn't. <br><br>But she wanted a former close friend of mine to think that. She brainwashed some people at work into thinking I was a bitch and she was doing exactly what she told them I did. The only problem was I was socially isolated because of my schizophrenia, so I couldn't stand up for themselves. They went to the Police about me to go through my phone for gossip, whilst I was psychotic. <br><br>I have to go back into therapy and all of that, they derailed my recovery and kept triggering me constantly. I just really needed to vent about this. They'd get voice messages from me and play them over and over laughing at how ridiculous I sounded. I knew they were lying to me and all hiding out in groups. They were cowards, they never confront you. They derailed my education as well. The bullying and gossip spread through a group. I'm sitting in a really emotionally toxic environment with rumours and pettiness shutting me down.<br><br>If you try to express yourself amongst people who are gossiping about you, and who get together and blow up petty things about you, you get shut down all the time. You get eye rolls, sarcasm, yeah right, afterwards they go off with people you have problems with or have done. It's impossible to make a dent or even get close to it. My iCloud account was fleeced as well, offline they were doing stuff to reference things I'd written about on iCloud. <br><br>Scary.
