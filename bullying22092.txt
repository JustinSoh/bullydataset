				It infuriates me when school bullying is treated as somehow less serious (and therefore more tolerated) than assault between adults. The problem I think is that children have less perceived and actual rights than adults.
<br>
<br>When I was a kid I was bullied mercilessly - the response was to either "smack them back" or "turn the other cheek." We wouldn't dream of saying either of these things to adults, why is it ok to say to children? We need to value children more.
<br>
<br>I agree that schools need to have a no-tolerance policy towards bullying. I know a lot of schools have this policy, I'm sorry it seems yours doesn't.
