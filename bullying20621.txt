				Hiya..<br><br>I'm really glad that you reported your co-worker for their appalling behaviour towards you and that the company you work for are dealing with things properly.<br>It can be a really difficult thing to do though and quite often, kind hearted people with low self esteem feel horribly guilty about reporting people..  <br>It feels horrible that you've got someone into trouble and this is because you didn't want to..  you would have preferred a peaceful way of fixing the situation..  <br>but, you didn't get the person into trouble, their actions did..   same as a person reporting a robber to the police doesn't get the robber into trouble, their own actions are what they're being punished for.<br>It sounds like you're probably feeling really awful about working with this person as well as feeling really bad about what's happened.. it might be a good idea to take the opportunity to talk to HR and tell them just how much this is affecting you and if possible, have a chat with a counsellor for a few sessions, just to build your self esteem back a little bit.<br><br>xx
