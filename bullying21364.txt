				I was too bullied in primary school, Was 5 against me though.<br>They pick on anyone to make themselves feel empowered and you feel weaker. Best way to do it is just laugh, If they try beat you up, Hit the guy square on the nose and run as fast as you can.<br><br>I got bullied by a girl because i was fat and she was the "hottest one in the primary school". I found her on facebook a few months ago and the tables have turned...<br><br>Wish you best of luck with your situaution =)
