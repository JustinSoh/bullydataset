				Thanks. <br>When I started working there, I did it because of wanting to contribute something to God. I feel like I have and although I have endured hardship, I feel like I've gotten closer to the Lord. I think it's because I have the right perspective- that people have freedom of choice and that they choose to be jerks sometimes, that Christians aren't perfect, and that my experience is between me and God. If my boss wants to be a jerk, that's her problem- not mine. I just do my best to follow Jesus' commandments.<br>I think my spirit has learned all that it can while working at the organization and I look forward to God providing the opportunity for me to move on.
