				Hi Airlea,
<br>
<br>You're on the right track! People ask questions, make small-talk, and this eventually blooms into friendships.  What are your interests?  Friendships usually bloom from those, from people liking the same things.
<br>
<br>Depending on where you live, there should be a way for you to get free, confidential care.  I don't know if you would be comfortable talking to your guidance counselor about it, or if s/he would be effective.  However, if you Google support groups in your area, you should be able to find something.  If you are near a university, and they have a large enough psychology department, you can call their general number to see if they have a program for training new shrinks.  A university near me has a program where you can get treatment for as little as $5 per session.  The only catch is that my program videotapes their clients, since it's for training purposes.  You can also look for hotlines in your area.  If you can't find something on Google, or in your local paper, CALL National Youth Crisis Hotline: 800-442-HOPE (4673)
<br>Provides counseling and referrals to local drug treatment centers, shelters, and counseling services. Responds to youth dealing with pregnancy, molestation, suicide, and child abuse. Operates 24 hours, seven days a week.  I found it on <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.allaboutcounseling.com/crisis_hotlines.htm" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank';">http://www.allaboutcounseling.com/crisis_hotlines.htm</a><!-- m -->.  They should be able to hook you up with some services in your area.  If you're thinking, "I can't call that, that's a crisis hotline!" don't worry.  You're trying to deal with something before it becomes a crisis.
<br>
<br>Having said that, you can try volunteering for something in your area.  Animal shelters usually need people to help take care of the animals.  You can take dogs for walks, or play with cats.  Bad people usually don't do the animal shelter thing.  You can make friends there.  If animals aren't your thing, you can volunteer with senior citizens.  They love to talk, and they have plenty of advice.  Some elderly people can be pretty cranky, though!  But isn't that true about all people? <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile">  If you look on <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank';">http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites</a><!-- m -->, you can see if there are "gigs" or "events" in your area.  In my city, there are lots of women looking for friends.  Just be safe about who you meet, always do so in a public place like a coffee shop.
<br>
<br>Hope this helps! Good luck!!!
