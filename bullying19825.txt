				i used to bully my sister alot... and when i was in first grade there was this girl woh everyone said was wierd and the teacher asked me to be her friend and i said "no, shes wierd." and looking back now i feel really awful, and i was bullied alot like that later so i know how she feels, which kinda makes it worse.

<br>anyway, your not alone, and the fact that your thinking about the people you bullied and being concerned if you might have hurt them proves that you're a good person.
