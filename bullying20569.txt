				Hi, I am really sorry for you, hope it will be over soon.
<br>
<br>With bullies, (in my view), there are two solutions.
<br>
<br>1. A messy martyrdom  and confrontation.  or
<br>
<br>2. No Contact and Silent Treatment. 
<br>
<br>I personally, choose  the 2nd choise,it is safer and in the long run the bully will back off.
<br>
<br>Bullies immitate, they ridicule weakness, they fear strength and bocome provocative. To implement 2nd choice successfully, you have to act, try to control your emotion no matter what the bully says, try to be normal, not a victim nor look victorious.
<br>
<br>Silent Treatment is a powerful manipulative tool, it hurts the bully too.
