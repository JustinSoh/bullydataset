<br>I suppose that what you are suggesting here is why not fight fire with fire i.e. use bullying tactics to fight bullies.
<br>
<br>Well, as I said, if one condemns a certain behaviour, then what is the justification for copying that behaviour?
<br>
<br>Ok, let's look at it another way.  Take this 'team of bullied people' you mention.  Who gets to join this team?  Such a team would just be a magnet for undercover bullies, wouldn't it?  So someone who gets their kicks out of bullying comes along, pretends to be a victim of bullying, and gets to join the team.  Then this team go out and bully the so-called bullies.  That means the undercover bully gets to go on bullying.  Then there may come a day when the only people in the team are bullies, not victims of bullying.   
<br>
<br>So that tactic is likely to encourage bullying, not stop it.  It will encourage bullying because it can be used by undercover bullies to keep on bullying.
