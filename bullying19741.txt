				Hi Kenneth,<br><br>I am sorry you were bullied as a child and treated so unfairly in college. I am not sure though what you mean when you ask how to take action? Do you see the problem as a deeper one that lies in the school system? It's my impression that you see bullying as something bigger than just some unenlightened individuals taking their frustrations on others, but I may be wrong. Can you explain?<br><br>WM
