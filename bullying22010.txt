				Many interesting ideas here.  We all are trying to understand better the causes of bullying, so we can deal with it more effectively.  Also we all depend heavily on our own experiences.<br><br>I've tried to define it for myself, in the simplest possible terms, recognizing that there are many layers of complexity involved as well.  But here are the three main steps I think are required to make a bully:<br><br>1.  The bully must first have a desire to gain an advantage over others around them.<br><br>2.  The bully's method for gaining advantage must rely on the tearing down or suppression of others, rather than building them up or creative or constructive work of their own.<br><br>3.  The bully's evaluation of gaining advantage by this method, must be that the advantage gained is possible/worthwhile for them, and outweighs any consequence that may result from their actions.<br><br>The reason this definition may be helpful is that understanding all three steps provides opportunities for responses, solutions, and interdiction.  The ideas put forward in this thread can be categorized under one or more of these steps.<br><br>It would seem that for the first step, most adults and most children don't have this desire.  Possibly because they are comfortable &amp; confident in themselves and their social standing.  I think this results from belonging to a secure culture, being loved and appreciated.  I also think this is partly what Birdie is after in her bully-free school.  So the basis of this first step is insecurity about themselves, at one or more levels.  An important lesson from this is that bullying begets bullying, through the mechanism of insecurity.<br><br>Then for the second step, the method is a reflection of what's been learned or demonstrated to the person, and their moral choices.  If a person identifies that personal gain can be had by putting down others, the expectation of most people would be to reject it as an improper &amp; immoral method.  It's somewhat like theft of self-esteem from another.  The target's esteem is driven down and the bully's is built up.  If this rejection does not occur, it indicates a shortfall in teaching &amp; upbringing, as well as lack of immediate reinforcement of proper values when improper behavior begins.  Without that, the bully absolutely will experience positive feedback from their actions.<br><br>Then for the third step, we as a society rely heavily on consequences as both punishment &amp; deterrent, but that obviously fails if the consequences are regarded as inconsequential.  So the bully requires confidence that they will succeed and not much will be done about their actions.  That represents a shortfall in society and our approach to discipline, especially for children for whom it is so important.  <br><br>So considering these three steps, many of the points that Rinus raised about children are relevant.  They do lack impulse control and a fully developed ability to distinguish moral issues on their own.  They should have solid backup from the people around them (parents, teachers, etc) to assist with their development of these characteristics.  Unfortunately some don't.<br><br>This also leads into the issue of discipline, and there too I think Rinus has a point.  You cannot discipline children if you are afraid they won't like you, or will retaliate.  The parent's need for the approval of their children is a serious impediment to their ability to parent.  It's possible to achieve both closeness with your children &amp; adequate discipline.  Many parents already do, as evidenced by the majority in step 1 that don't feel the need to bully.<br><br>In my earlier post, I discussed some of the reasons why schools also are afraid of discipline.  So if a child doesn't have it at home, and doesn't have it at school, we shouldn't be surprised that bullies arise.<br><br>When I think of these issues, what occurs to me is that society is too willing to ignore problems that don't immediately concern us.  We are aware of bullies but don't do anything unless we are directly affected.  So we tolerate them without approving of them, but the effect is the same as accepting them.  That's also the message that's ultimately received by the target, and makes them feel helpless.  I think that feeling is as damaging as any other aspect of their abuse.  I think this is why Birdie's idea is so appealing, in the social climate of her school, bullying wouldn't be tolerated or accepted, and the school would respond as a whole, no matter who was affected.  I think that element is critical, the uniformity &amp; consistency of the response must be complete &amp; highly cohesive.  Right now we have Swiss cheese, lots of holes to enable the bully.  We need to close ranks and have a unified front.<br><br>Also in my earlier post I talked about shunning/disciplining the bully and strongly supporting the target, when bullying does occur.  I think this changes the equation for steps 2 and 3 for the bully, if they see clearly that it won't be accepted and they won't succeed.  It also helps the target to understand that what was done to them is not acceptable on any terms, which I think can help to limit the damage.
