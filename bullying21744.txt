So, following your logic, if your colleague was treated unfairly and made to feel bad, you would feel a little better?  Not because you're an evil person and like to see people suffer, but because perhaps you'd have an ally or someone to commiserate with about the terrible working conditions.  Only you can determine whether that could possibly be an accurate assumption.  You're upset because you feel targeted, but you also provided evidence that you're working under unprofessional bosses who treat their employees like crap.  As someone else mentioned, the unfair treatment seems to be a universal problem rather than a personal vendetta against you (early on at least).    <br><br>Before all of the drama went down, did you ever approach your colleague to have a conversation about your problems with him?  I apologize if I'm mistaken, but I vaguely recall that you may have bypassed him and went straight to his boss to complain.  I'm wondering how things would have played out if you went to him first.  Going above someone's head in the workplace, especially when they are favored, is asking for trouble.  Even if the thought of going to him first crossed your mind, but you didn't act on it because you knew it would be pointless and he would just dismiss you, take a deep breath and do it anyway.  Be assertive.<br><br>Why?  For one thing, to say you did.  Given that you two are the only ones with your job description and you work closely, you owed it to him or, at the very least, given him a head's up that you planned to discuss it with the boss.  That way, you don't look like a tattle and he's not blindsided.  Plus, you never know what someone will say or how they will respond until you ask.  The guy's an arrogant a$$, appeal to his arrogance.  Getting along with someone doesn't mean you have to like them.  Apparently, he's doing something right.  Less work, longer lunches, resources, etc.  He could have taught you a lot about office politics.  If you say something like, "I gotta hand it to you, you've got everyone wrapped around your little finger.  Impressive!  How do you pull that off?" he will likely respond positively.  It may take some time, but jobs are for the long-haul.      <br><br>It's hard to change people's perceptions of you and how they treat you after working with them for a long time, but focus on yourself and stop worrying about what other people are doing, saying, getting, etc. if it doesn't involve you.  I can only imagine how mentally exhausted you must be.  Pick your battles, and try to avoid waging war against a potential ally.  While your work environment seems to be a factor of your current problems, this probably won't be the last time you work for crappy bosses and have arrogant colleagues.  Try a different approach and see how that goes for you.
