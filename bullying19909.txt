				Thanks.<br><br>That story does make me feel better; most of these idiots are just all bark and no bite.<br><br>I'm not too concerned as to how I'll handle situations like this in the future; I KNOW her response was completely abnormal and there isn't any mentally stable person in the world who would respond the way she did.<br><br>I just don't feel comfortable knowing that she got off scott-free for what she did because I did not have the energy to argue or fight with her.<br><br>1. She cut me off while I was talking, started shouting and swearing at me at the top of her lungs for about a minute or two, and continued shouting in my direction even after I walked away.<br><br>2. She interrupted me from my work AGAIN, after I tried being the bigger person and letting her have time to vent her anger out.<br><br>3. I did not have all day for this, and I did not have time for potential legal consequences if the altercation became physical, so I just apologized with feigned sincerity to her.<br><br>I think I feel kind of the same way people feel after they've been mugged or raped.  You don't feel comfortable unless the perpetrator is brought to justice.
