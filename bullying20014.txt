				I'm sorry to hear what happened, Unimportant. I can only imagine how you feel now, looking back on all that. Thank for your support though. I'm glad for my mother and sister too. Dad should also get credit for helping out and supporting me even though he was away at work most of the time.<br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Unimportant wrote:</cite>Today, it still crosses my mind once in a while, and I feel I have not done my best. Yet, I can not change the past.</div></blockquote><br>I feel the same way, really. I sometimes wonder if I could have done more to stop it, which is unlikely.<br><br>I doubt I'd get much of a reply for the Head (even if I knew where he was). As for contacting the bullies...I don't know. I don't who or where they are. It's strange. Part of me has always wanted an answer and yet, sometimes, the reason never mattered. All I know is that I was bullied because I was different in some way. <br>I'll look into it though, see what I can find to start with.  It probably won't be hard until I decide to do something about it.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral">
