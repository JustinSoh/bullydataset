				My stepson was bullied in his sophmore year by some spoiled rich kid jock punks aka the populars. The school was no help as the rich kid populars are held to a lower standard same as the rich plutocrats in society as a whole.  I told him to beat the crap out of the ring leader and deal with the consequences of that. He was reluctant to do that and his mother was worried about the legal consequences and reprisals.  Instead of beating this kid to a bloody pulp, (if he didn't I would have wearing a ski mask) he got the kid alone and told him that if the bullying did not stop that he would go to this punk's house while his family was sleeping, set the house on fire and shoot them all as they came running out. It worked like a charm. <br><br>Punks are motivated by two things... fear and money.  Some of the school shootings were provoked by bullying although in all the cases the shooters were fueled by SSRIs or some other prescription drug.  My stepson would never have executed this kid and his family although doing so would have had a net positive effect on the world.  If the bullying had continued the ring leader would have had to deal with a masked man, aluminum baseball bat and knee replacement surgery.<br><br>Complaining to the school or even to the police can make it wose for the victim. Let's say that I had to break this kid's legs to get him to cease the bullying. It would be a positive thing. Our local hospital would get some business, the bully would have a tough time bullying with broken knee joints and broken teeth and fingers.<br><br>Look at it like this. You can let your kid be bullied and become a professional victim. You can pay for years of therapy that probably won't work or for 1000 bucks you can have the severely beaten and terrorized. The bully will learn a quick lesson in cause and effect and your child will not be scarred for life.
