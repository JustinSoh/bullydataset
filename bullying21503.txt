				I had a dream this week. I was pursued by some known criminal and tried to run away, until i escaped closing the door. When i woke up, i had that sensation in the jaw that i have since i left that job.<br>Today i watched the website of the company :  more then 40% of the company are new. He is slowly replacing the sick ones  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad">
