				Mick, thanks so much. It means alot to me to know that somebody cares. I really was going to end it. But I came across a quote " Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem ", and I understood that it isn't worth it. I'm 13 by the way. But thakyou so much. it means so much to me. Really.
