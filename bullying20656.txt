				Hi hurtingbadly,<br><br>I think you may be looking for meaning where there isn't anymore meaning.   Sometimes an abusive person is just what they seem to be.  Sure, they can put on a good show of being kind when they want something (usually sex or money), but once they get what they want, their true colors come out.  Thing is, the abused partner hangs in there then for various reasons such as:<br><br>You want to believe there is more depth to the person.<br><br>You want to believe that if you can just get through to them, they will change, go back to being who they pretended to be at first.<br><br>A belief that if a person is hard to get, if you can fix them, or 'crack their code', that somehow they'll end up being a good long term partner.<br><br>To try and salvage our egos because it feels like the abusive person must have a hell of a strong ego to be so blatantly abusive, to have so easily damaged our self-esteem, so we may feel compelled to compete and keep-up with them, to prove we are just as strong.<br><br>Because on some level you are struggling with your own issues, and though you don't necessarily want to be hurt, a part of you is attracted to abuse (figuring out why requires a lot of introspection).<br><br>Other reasons.<br><br>Let me ask this... he has shown you how he is.  What more do you need to know about him to feel at peace that you know enough?
