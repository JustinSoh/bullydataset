				I share 5 tips I am using to deal with my sisters school and their negligence towards bullying. My little sister was being bullied. The school knew and did not tell us. My baby sister broke down crying in the middle of the room where she was playing. out of the blue. After a lot of digging she told me about her bully. She told me the principal knew about it. She told me the teacher said she doesn't want to hear about it anymore. No one notified me or my parents. We had to find out from a nervous breakdown. SHE IS IN 4TH GRADE AND SHE HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. I didn't know what to do. I reached out to my community for help. They gave me great advice which I compiled into 5 tips that I am sharing with you WHEN YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL NEGLECTS THEM. I WANT YOU TO KNOW I AM NOT MAD AT THE KID WHO BULLIED MY SISTER, I AM MAD AT THE FACULTY OF *mod edit* FOR THEIR NEGLIGENCE. The kids talked it out and they will work on building a future friendship.
