				mrmr, it doesn't sound to me, as if you have anything to apologize for.   The girl you were 'bullying' seems to be of the thinking that you were just passing harmless banter or comments, and if she has forgiven you, and realises you weren't serious, then I would let it drop.  She seems to have.  I must say, I admire you for recognising that your comments could have been harmful.  Most bullies don't give two hoots.
