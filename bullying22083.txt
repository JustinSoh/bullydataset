I also have a difficult time during many social situations.  I like to stay in comfort zones most of the time, and not try too many new and unfamiliar things.  My 10 year reunion is coming up in 2011, and I doubt that I will be going.  I have stayed in touch with those who meant something to me.  Keep on living, exl.<br><br>AJ
