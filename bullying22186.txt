				23 yr old male, bullied through school, abused in childhood, anorexic for four years, now bpd..<br><br>see how easy it was. did it make me appear wounded? nah.<br><br>but if i say, 23 year old male, no friends, afraid of going out, was crying in school throughout, abused by my very own cousin who was supposed to protect me, havent eaten much, made myself mega thin, very ill, now SUFFERING from bpd.<br>this makes me sound wounded<br><br>it all depends on how you say it, if you talk to this christian friend slowly and one problem at a time. say it as a matter of fact, not as a sad story and things will be fine<br>even i dont have many friends, dont believe in letting my problems out<br><br>when you support your friend you could say, 'hey you know when i was a child this incident happened with me with this girl but that's life.' place your hand on your friend's shoulder and say, 'we're all humans and we've all been through rough times, now come let's go out for a drink'
