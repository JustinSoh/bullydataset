				I was severely abused as a child and kept very isolated. I was bullied at school as long as I can remember. I'm now mostly agoraphobic, PTSD, major depression, homeless, panic attacks, no friends, no job, etc. When I tell someone that I wish I was "normal" and they respond casually with "Well, what's normal anyway?", I get so upset. It happens almost every time!<br><br>Anybody else get upset by this question?
