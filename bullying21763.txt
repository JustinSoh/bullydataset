				Was bullied as child...was over stupid things and being slapped on back of head 80% od days on bus, i was bigger than my bullies so they prob didnt feel confident enough to take it further...<br><br>As an adult was bullied was much worse...ended up abusing light drugs and developed some symptoms of anti social personality disorder...<br><br>As a kid bullying was a pain but as an adult its destroyed my confidence, self esteem etc....<br><br>I guess the experience of what bullying is worse is quite subjective and depends on factors like who you went to school with etc
