				Being the omega male I am, I've been the object of a great deal of verbal bullying in the past few years (I am in high school). The purpose of this thread isn't to gain sympathy from the reader, so don't bother tapping me on the shoulder telling me that I should be strong and whatever.<br><br>Until recently, I was shy beyond stupidity, extremely awkward, and all this manifested in extraordinarily defensive body language (walking with my head down, avoiding eye contact, speaking quietly, etc). In short, I was odd.<br><br>Partially, not entirely, that I ended up like this was my fault. I withdrew from society intentionally when I was 12 - I was not rejected, in fact, I was actively sought after by my friends.  It was my, free, decision. Also, I never participated in any sports for years so I became physically fragile.<br><br>Still, I had extremely bad growing-up, psychologically abusive mother, parental fights, etc. I, myself, have attracted a few mental illnesses myself as a consequence and even spent a month in a mental hospital last year.<br><br>Still, however, the fact that I almost intentionally chose to be a social outcast, is my - or anyone who makes similar choices - suffering warranted? If you want to be respected, you need to be willing to put in the effort to fit in, one which I never did. Though I am working to change this.
