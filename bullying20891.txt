We did this quite a bit when we were younger, as a harmless prank and also to show off.  It isn't actually necessary to lift the car.  As you pull up on the back bumper, the suspension transfers weight to the front wheels.  At some point you can drag or slide the back end.  2 or 3 guys are enough to do this, if the car is small.<br><br>I believe you because the woman asked how you got in there, which implies the angle was such that you couldn't have driven directly in.  Part of the fun of the prank is watching people try to figure out how it happened.  We did this to people we knew and hung around so we could move it back.  It would be cruel to do it to someone and leave them trapped.<br><br>Also with regard to your NetFlix account being hacked, that is possible if your password is stolen.  That can happen if you login from an insecure or compromised computer.   Or someone may have observed you logging in, or guessed your password, or had access to your computer with the password list.  None of these would be obvious to you at the time.  It may be a coincidence that is unrelated to the work folks.  You should change your passwords, if you haven't already.<br><br>With regard to the bullies, it may help to remember that a bully's goal is to pass along their own unhappiness.  Happy people have no need to torment others.  So the best way to defeat a bully is simply not to react.  That deprives them of their goal and they will eventually move on.  If you feel a reaction is needed, you can say something like "why are you so unhappy?".  That puts the focus where it belongs, on them and not on you.  You may get a nasty response, but if so you can ignore it and know your answer hit home.  Just remember it isn't really about you at all, it's about them.  <br><br>If they persist even after you don't react, then you have a more serious problem akin to harassment or stalking.  Those things are against the law, so you should still not react but document it, gather evidence and report it.  Use your phone to record it or have a friend do so.  You need a couple repeated instances to demonstrate it's not simple bullying or a one-off thing.  Both workplace rules and the law would support you, as long as you have independent proof.<br><br>I don't think you'd have to leave or move unless you felt isolated to the point that you are alone and have no friends, because they won't accept you.  That seems unlikely but it does happen.  I hope that won't be the case for you.</div></blockquote><br><br>I think at this point, moving away may be my only option. I have been harassed quite a few times, but reporting it is SO hard that its easier to just deal with it. Most of the time the person doing the harassing is a big coward, so its not too hard to get rid of them. What I have had to deal with as an adult doesn't even begin to compare with what I was dealing with in high school, just the memory of it is worse than anything. I think its very important for my life that I move away, because all the people my age (the population is mostly aging) are the same old people that I've had to deal with for years.  <br><br>That's great advice, the why are you so unhappy thing, never heard of that it's a good one. Thank you for taking the time to give good, solid advice. <br><br>It's very easy to tell who the reasonable people are on this forum.
