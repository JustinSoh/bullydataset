				Hi,<br><br>Here are a few things that may help.<br><br>1.)	What happened to you was not because of you or your fault.  Bullies are masters at making excuses, manipulate you into giving sympathy, accusing you that you did something.  You haven’t done anything, so forgive yourself first because there was one in your life.<br>2.)	For me, the forgiveness isn’t as helpful as obtaining knowledge.  Knowledge is power.  There are two major groups in my life (there are more, but for this topic, I’m going to limit it to two).  The first group are the people who inspire me to be better.  The second group are the people who have taught me who I will not be.  I give thanks to both groups.  The second group tells me that I have to get educated on how not to let it happen again.  That makes me stronger and that inspires me.<br>3.)	Bullies are very good at being uninvited into your head.  Depending on how recent the event happened, the more space they take up in my head.  Time will lesson it.  Since I put my energy in becoming a stronger person and not a target, there isn’t any space left for them.<br><br>Do you read?  Listen to books?  Website research?  If so, let me know and I’ll share what I’ve gathered and tried.<br><br>Just my humble opinion.
