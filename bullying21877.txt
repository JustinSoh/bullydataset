				I've written a few drafts but have a hard time keeping them as my thoughts go back in circles of self pity. <br><br>To sum up my experience: Was bullied by parents. Then bullied by "friends." Got depressed for years and finally developed a clear perspective. Relapsed towards the end of college -- Went from having clear perspective to feeling so low that I allowed myself to be manipulated and abused by others who I saw as weak. Trying now to remain aware of that now.
