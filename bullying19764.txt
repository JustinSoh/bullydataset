				Punch them all in the nose, works for me.

<br>Also try this, sounds stupid but it works honestly. Every morning when you wake up go and look in a mirror at yourself, properly mind, look into your own eyes and tell yourself that you're a good person and that you deserve to be respected and that you love yourself. Actually say it out loud, don't just think it, do it for a couple of minutes everyday, it'll be hard at first because you'll feel daft and you'll subconciously undermine what you're saying by thinking the obvious but eventually you'll click and you'll believe it.
<br>Honestly try it.
<br>
<br>This isn't a wind up I've done it myself and I know it works.
