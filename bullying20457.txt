To tell you the truth, I don't know who Mr. Ben is. Even if you have a voice that may sound similar to him, that doesn't mean that you are him. Every one has a unique voice. Instead of seeing your voice as something bad, see it as your own, something to be proud of. If kids laugh at it, laugh with them. Eventually, they will see it as normal. For example, I feel like I have an abnormally large nostrils, but it's mine. If people find your voice silly, then they are still immature. Just smile and realize this. Everyone is still immature at certain areas; let yourself understand this. The important thing is for you to believe that a voice is a voice, not who you are.<br><br>"People who mind don't matter; people who matter don't mind."<br><br>I hope this helps even a little.
