				When I was in prison, there wasn't much to do but talk.<br><br>As you might expect the lowlives in prison love to be spiteful and gossip. Always looking to <br>put someone down to make themselves feel superior.<br><br>The guards were pretty much the same, just thugs, sadists, hacks.<br><br>But I digress.<br><br>At one point, a young kid was pointed out to me in the yard, and I was told what was supposedly his story.  He was in for a long stretch, for murder.<br><br>Seems this kid had an older brother who perpetually bullied him.<br>One day they were sitting at the table and the kid was having trouble opening a bag of chips.<br>You know how that can sometimes be a bit tricky or frustrating, it has happened to all of us.<br><br>The kid reached for a steak knife to puncture and slice open the bag.<br><br>His brother laughed with hate and contempt, sneering, "Look at the little PUSSY! So weak he needs a knife to open a bag of chips!"<br><br>The kid then did the right thing. He stabbed his brother to death with that steak knife.<br><br>Now, in that moment I wanted to go over to that kid in the yard and shake his hand, hug him, tell him that he was my hero, and that he did the right thing.<br><br>I didn't. Can't remember why.  I never did talk to him.  I regret that.<br><br>**********<br><br>There are degrees of murder in the law.  Based primarily upon what was in the mind of the killer at the time.<br><br>I'm wondering why there are not degrees of victimization.  Maybe there are. I don't know.<br><br>But where is the understanding in the world that injuries are not all felt equally?<br><br>All my life I've been hearing "No one likes a tattletale", "you're the only one complaining"<br>"suck it up, be a man", "dont be a #######1, stop complaining"<br><br>Emotional wounds don't show.  And they never ever  heal. And absolutely no one cares.<br><br>**************<br><br>********************<br><br>When the news reports that some kid walked into a school and shot his teachers, or someone shot up a movie theater, what is your first thought?<br><br>Do you think, "That's terrible!" ?<br><br>My first thought is, "I wonder what they did to piss him off?"<br><br>When any group torments someone so much that they are moved to murder, that is a very GOOD thing.  Because that group is corrupt and has totally failed.<br><br>If even one person is bullied, EVERYONE in the group is responsible, and deserves death.<br>That is the only way to end bullying, to make every single individual totally accountable.<br><br>No more turning the other way, pretending not to see. No more telling the victim to "suck it up".<br><br>Literal death sentence for bullies and those who harbor bullies.<br><br>That is what I call for, by law.<br><br>*mod edit*<br><br><br>****************<br><br><br>************<br><br>************
