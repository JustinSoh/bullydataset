				Dear Ada,<br><br>Thank you for you interest. I did talk to the boss who was keen to help, he is a true gentleman, but curled back the next day asking him not to say anything. He asked me if I was okay and replied that D... must be just testing my skills and ability to work under pressure and that I liked this new challenge. He smiled and said: Well, fair enough.<br><br>This morning first thing, I cornered D... that was sitting at computer in the office and asked him if there was any particular reason he would not talk to me, if I done something wrong etc... He kept his eyes on his screen and sighed.. then he mumbled something like unless he knows someone for long enough, he would generally not talk to that person.. Woah....So I smiled and answered: well okay...but just want to let you know that I think you are a good bloke and i like working with you.<br><br>I did not get an answer on that one and was not expecting one. I added as well that he probably have noticed that I considerately improved my work since I started and that I know he was probably aware of it, then said okay D...., see you on stage.<br><br>D... is probably... for sure... trying to dominate the game, but I still find this a very curious technique. I never seen this before... I think I feel blessed in the end as it must be somehow energy consuming to avoid talking to someone in a work environnement, so I guess I have to appreciate the efforts he is putting up for me to make me feel special.<br><br>How's that?
