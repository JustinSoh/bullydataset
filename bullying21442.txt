				its a virous crcle &amp; always will be,its human instint that nether schools or goverment can do to stop,or they can do is provent ,but stopping it ,no one can do. in one word theres no cure .if parents bullied at school etc they most likely to pass it on to the siblings who will in turn do the same ,we can educate but thats it. take alook at channel 4s sex education show ,why do we have it ? education ,you wont cure that ,again human instint.
