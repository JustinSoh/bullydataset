				I am 29. I am still in therapy. I am still not over the bullying.<br><br>I really wish people would understand how deeply bullying can hurt and how long the effects can last.<br>So here is my story. Its kind of long, so bear with me.<br><br>It started in 5th grade for me. I broke my leg and was made fun of relentlessly by a boy. It bothered me a lot but I never told anyone. I figured it was just a "boys will be boys" thing. I also got laughed at because I had trouble with math and had to go to a special class for extra help. That continued into 6th grade. During those 2 years, I also got made fun of every day by 2 boys who walked the same way home as me. They teased me about my last name. I ended up changing it when I turned 18.<br><br>The bullying wasn't just at school. My brother picked on me at home too. My family brushed it off as typical sibling rivalry but he was MEAN to me. He hit me a lot, called me fat...and even introduced me to his friends as "fat cow". He made me self conscious at a very young age.<br><br>My first year in Jr. High was ok. I actually spent the year protecting a friend of mine from bullies.<br><br>8th grade is when it got bad. It started when we had to do a group project. I got put into a group with 4 guys. One of which decided to start picking on me, while the other 3 laughed. I went to the teacher, only to have him bully me too.<br>The guy started hitting me as days went on. Threw things at me...and even tried to light my hair on fire as I walked to a friends house one day. I went home crying day after day. My brother eventually went after him and the guy did stop. He did die in a boating accident the following summer. I came to learn that he bullied his sister just as badly as he did me. There was also an incident in the school yard that still haunts me. I was standing near a large puddle at lunch time. A guy ran into me full speed and knocked me into the puddle...in front of the entire school. I was drenched and dirty from head to toe. Everyone laughed. I was so humiliated. I was also jumped by a group of guys because I wouldn't give one of them a dollar for the bus. I got called fat cow at school a lot that year too. As if I didn't hear enough of that at home. -_-<br><br>9th grade started out great. I had a huge group of "friends" and I was actually pretty happy for once. It all ended one day when one of the girls asked me to buy something for her at lunch and I said no. ALL of them turned on me right then and I was left with no friends. Random incidents of guys picking on me still occurred. <br><br>High school. This is where I got picked on by teachers the most. I had to drop out of 3 classes because of them. Despite the fact that I complained to the principal, nothing was done. The school board was involved with I was threatened with expulsion for dropping one of the classes. Another teacher got pleasure out of calling me stupid in front of my friends. She had mistaken my Social Anxiety for stupidity.<br>I didn't get picked on by any one particular person or group...but just random guys throwing snowballs at me, food, drinks.<br><br>I thought my bullying days were behind me once I graduated. I was wrong though. That's when the cyber bullying started. There was even an entire website made about me. <br><br>So yeah. That is my story. Probably sounds similar to many others but felt the need to share. I am hoping that through therapy, I can learn to move past these horrible memories.<br>Just want to say that despite how much it hurts, you gotta try to stay strong. Don't be afraid to reach out to someone. Even if its a total stranger. There is always someone there who cares.<br><br>I am here for anyone who reads this that may need someone to vent to...or if you need advice/encouragement. <br>Bullying really, really hurts but it does get better...eventually.
