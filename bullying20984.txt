				Sometimes I just try to stay from that person as best as I can.  Another thing is to answer with honesty and say something like "Why do you think I can't get good grades on my own, do you think I'm stupid or something?"  I don't believe that they don't actually realize how they come across.  They seem like they are put downs imo, so you could just confront them, why do you say this or that to me?  It might not get them to stop because a bully is a bully and they love to get under our skin, but at least you are not turning a blind eye to what they are doing.  <br><br>It's hard to overcome some negative remarks at times,  as time passes and you gain more insight into who those bullies really are, you can feel proud of yourself for all that you have accomplished and it doesn't bother you one bit what they have said to you because you truly do know that you are none of those things they are insinuating.  I hope this helps.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">
