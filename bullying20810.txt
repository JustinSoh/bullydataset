I saw another side of him I never thought I would.<br><br>While I was there with him this last time there was a time when he grabbed me in a rough way, I told him he was hurting me and to stop but he didn't. He had sex with me at that time and I didn't feel well about it. I was thinking for myself that that felt a bit like being forced somehow. Coincidentally, the next morning he brought up (out of the blue) the topic of raping. My brother in law had called him months before to tell him that the way he was treating wasn't right and this guy told me that morning (after grabbing me roughly the night before) that my brother in law had accused him of raping women. I was shocked because I know my brother in law never said this to him and what a coincidence! he brings that up after the previous night I sort of felt that way.<br><br>Ok, then, one of these days he told me to watch the scene of Maleficient movie where Angelina Jolie's wings are cutt off. He said: "mind, I didn't cut your wings off". I hadn't watched the movie and didn't have a clue what this was about and then I read on google that the movie actually is about abuse and that particular scene is a metaphor for rape. I have no clue what he is trying to tell me but he clearly said he didn't cut off my wings.<br><br>Then we were sending some messages on whatsapp and he basically told me that he won't meet me again, that it was out of the question because I push him out of his comfort zone and I interfere with his social network. I was so hurt at the cold way he was talking to me plus he had said something I didn't understand and he told me I was illiterate, stupid and dead slow on the uptake. He also told me I am useless. At that moment I went and I told him that he might not meet again because I interfere with his whores but that I won't meet him again because I don't meet beaters. Straight away he blocked me on whatsapp and Skype and that is how it is now. He has blocked me in the past too and then he unblocked me, I suppose because I was after him. I have no clue what will happen anymore.
