				I was bullied throughout school because I was poor and too quiet to stick up for myself. I would hang around the wrong crowd anyway because, even though I wasnt "cool", I wasnt really a "dork" either. Eventually it got to a point where I was jumped and beaten with wood at the basketball court nearby. I was bruised for two weeks and that was the last straw.
<br>
<br>But thats when I met a guy who was a lot like me. He would sit in his bedroom watching TV a lot, so I thought he wouldn't mind if I sat around with him... so I did. I am thankful for his compassion he had for me because he probably saved a part of me that way.
<br>
<br>The thing about it is is that kids these days respect strength. Even though I was bullied, I was always stronger than they were.
<br>
<br>When I got jumped, or when I got in fights with people, over stupid things, I would not fight back. I was hurt that I didnt fight back for a very long time, but then I realized that part of me is like my father. Part of me is a monster, and if I fought back then I would have probably killed them.
<br>
<br>
<br>I am not like them, even though I am a strong man. When I think of it that way I dont feel bad about it. What hurts me though is that I am only 23 and kids these days have it harder than I did. There are more gangs now, more sex, and more lawlessness than there was in my day... and "my day" wasn't too long ago.
<br>
<br>
<br>That is why I think this election is important. One of the things they are talking about is paying teachers more. I think that teachers arent paid enough and dont have the skills required to negate behavior like that. I did manage to get into an program called PINS that helped me out a lot because I met a woman who was __AWESOME!!!__ but she had to leave once she got pregnant and the teacher that took over was just a sub.... i was very sad. we need more teachers like mrs garren who care about us, because the sad truth is that most teachers do not care at all.
