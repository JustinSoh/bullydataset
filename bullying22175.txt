				Hey again Giulia<br><br>I'm glad to hear that the ADHD isn't too bad, though sorry to hear about the hearing problem too.  Can appreciate where you're coming from on constant pushing to get what you need from people at times, as well as what you said on pushing for a needed diagnosis to get the right help.   Though I don't have the same conditions as yourself, I do have some physical problems going on at the moment that I'm having to do the same with.  It's a very frustrating process.   <br><br>In relation to thoughts about wishing some of these uncaring health professionals, for once, would get to see what it's like to be on the receiving end of such treatment I've had the same thoughts go through my mind.  Especially after a bad hospital experience I had to go through earlier on in the year, because of some very frightening severe nerve pains I was experiencing at the time.    I had to see something along the lines of 3 nurses and two doctors.  Only one doctor out of those 4 people appeared to give a genuine damn about what was happening with me, while the others acted, for the most part, like they couldn't have cared less and just wanted me discharged as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, I only got to talk to the decent person for all of 5 minutes and had to spend most of the rest of the time with the other.  Because of how they treated me, I had the same sorts of thoughts and feelings towards them, and to this day I still wish the same.   I can totally understand why you think and feel that way.<br><br>It's good that you are pursuing your legal studies.   I wish you all the best with that, as well as with the interview too!  Sounds like you have alot going on to keep you busy! <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div><cite>Giulia wrote:</cite>What keeps your sanity with bully doctors ? <br>What keeps you from becoming suicidal when you are snap judged, lectured and patronized by a doctor ?<br>How do you get the care you need even when they don't believe you that you have something serious ? <br>Have your health been seriously damaged because of bully doctors, like having serious, even potentially fatal complications you could avoid if the problem was taken earlier ? <br>Enough talked about me, it's your turn now <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink"></div></blockquote><br><br>In relation to keeping my sanity, thankfully I don't often have to see the problem GP at my local GP surgery right now.  There's another one I can see instead who's much better to deal with, and so I tend to normally just make a point of booking appointments with him instead.  From time to time, I do have to deal with the other one. But it's really not often at all these days.   If the other GP wasn't there, or suddenly had to leave though, then I'd definitely find the situation alot more stressful and difficult to deal with.   I do count myself very lucky I have family to support me, and one of them would be willing to come with me to appointments if things ever got really bad.  <br><br>In terms of not becoming suicidal when dealing with the problem doctor, again I think it helps that I don't have to see him very often, and again having my family's support.  <br><br>With getting care, I remember that when going through the nerve pain problems I was earlier in the year - and this problem GP was not acknowledging I was experiencing nerve pain symptoms - there was an emergency GP service I was able to contact through the national health system over here in England.  With my family's help, I saw some other GP's through this service.   Because of what I reported to this problem GP about what they had to say, he finally had to start taking what I'd been trying to tell him seriously.  I'd probably have to use the same kind of approach if the same kind of problem ever came up again, and for some reason I couldn't see the other GP I normally do.<br><br>I wouldn't say that my health has been seriously damaged in any way directly through bullying doctors.  <br>However, I would say a combination of child abuse and peer bullying experiences while growing up has certainly done my mental health no favours.   Further bullying experiences at work since haven't helped, and I certainly do worry that one day, if I ever get anything else badly wrong, and am forced into a situation of dealing with a bad doctor, that it could seriously damage my health in some way then.  <br><br>I hope that was enough info! lol!  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink">
