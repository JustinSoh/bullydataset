				I can see your point clearly but it is still never nice to hear about someone being bullied; or to be bullied yourself, as I and you have been.  However, like you, I have also been the bully.  So, I know how easy it is to get carried-away and not realise what you are doing.  Your boss' decision is pretty dumb, by the way.

<br>In a case recently here in Ireland, a girl was bullied for her good looks and she ended-up killing herself.  There was another case perhaps two years ago where a young boy - bullied by his schoolmates - killed himself and left a note listing all the names of thos that bullied him.

<br>Bullying CAN make us stronger but, for many of us, it makes us weaker.
