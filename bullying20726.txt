				When I was six years old, my family moved from Brentwood to North Weald, so I started a new primary school. I was bullied from the word go for a few reasons.
<br>
<br>-Hair colour
<br>-Mole on forehead
<br>-Quiet
<br>-A bit slow (Yet ahead in various subjects)
<br>-Was in a wheelchair when travelling to and from school
<br>-Had to stay indoors during lunch and break for a couple years
<br>
<br>I have Reynauds Syndrome-type-thingie, you see. 'Thus the wheelchair and staying indoors, I was very sensitive to the cold. Unlike at my last school where something like that would have been interesting to students, at this school I was bullied for it. 
<br>
<br>I had no friends. I spent lunch and break walking around the edge of the playground over and over again. I sat by myself in the dining hall. In class, I sat by myself. Students did various things to me, from kicking my ankles when I was walking, to pinning me against the wall, to grabbing my hair and smacking my head into the ground, to telling me that they wished I would drown and die because I couldn't swim.
<br>
<br>Kids are lovely.
<br>
<br>So, then I went onto secondary school, and a lot of the same student went there - so automatically the bullying followed, which other students took up. I had one friend and she kept me going all through secondary school, along with the few others who spoke to me every now and then - preventing me from completely losing faith in humanity.
<br>
<br>At secondary school it seemed to escalate. There was a rumour that I was racist (why some girl spread this I do not know, but it seemed just a way to make people who didn't know in Year 7 to hate me.) which was not fun, there was the usual random verbal bullying. I had stones thrown at me, bottles, cans, rubbers, sharpeners, paper, etc. This was an every day thing. 
<br>
<br>In year 9, someone let on that I was bisexual.
<br>
<br>Suddenly everything became ten times worse.
<br>
<br>Everything before - but suddenly I was a school celebrity. Everyone knew my name. I kid you not, I was known by most students in every year. 
<br>
<br>I could not walk without harassment.
<br>
<br>I was stalked from class to class, during lunch, during break. 
<br>
<br>I was asked disgusting and blunt questions, asked the usual "Why are you a lesbian?", any girl that went near me was automatically in for verbal abuse so I became even more of a social recluse. I tried desperately to make my best friend keep away from me so that she didn't have to watch what was happening, to be harassed like I was. 
<br>
<br>I got kicked and smacked in corridors, constant homophobic abuse, in one class a girl spat and shouted at me - she laughed at me, and she held my head and repeatedly smacked me in the face with a ruler. The teacher saw, and did nothing. 
<br>
<br>I reported the bullying. I ignored it, I fought back, I laughed at it, I ran away from it, I confronted it.
<br>
<br>Nothing worked. 
<br>
<br>One day I was sexually harassed on a bus and I broke down the next day, unable to go in the same classroom as the person who did it - but I was too paranoid to tell anyone, so eventually I had to. 
<br>
<br>I missed a lot of class, hiding to do work in my head of year's office. He never tried to prevent the bullying, but he gave me that little safe haven. 
<br>
<br>I started to cry every day. I would hurt myself. I would hate myself. I had an eating disorder. The muscles wasted away in my knees, I had difficulty walking, the depression would make me constantly feeling physically sick. 
<br>
<br>One day I completely broke down in a corridor in front of a lot of students and a teacher, I fell down to my knees and shouted and asked why it happened to me, I simply could not get up off of the floor. 
<br>
<br>Nothing ever changed.
<br>
<br>I am a socially awkward person, I suffer with anxiety, I have trust issues and I also suffer with paranoia. 
<br>
<br>This is what bullying did to me. 
<br>
<br>To this day, two years later, I sometimes break down and cry and wonder why oh why did everyone hate me so much? I never did one thing wrong.
