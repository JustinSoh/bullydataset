				I am at a bit of a loss to understand the origin and reasoning of some of the comments here.  I think it fair to say that bullying comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, but one of the main forms of bullying is the threat of, or use of violence.<br><br>Since, as an adult, I am entitled to live without such a threat; and anyone causing me to believe that I might suffer injury at their hand is guilty of assault; it seems mad to suggest that the same protection should not apply to youngsters as it does to adults.<br><br>Bullying, is, by its very definition a power play.  To exert this sort of influence of a weaker individual is ethically and morally flawed.<br><br>The Bully, therefore should be penalised and called by his true name. The Agressor.  In a civilised society such an individual would be dealt with by our legal system.
