				We do not have school shootings here in the uk. Tho in twenty years time it could be; tho guns are much less prevalant here in the uk. In fact, the authorities are quite phobic. See Dunblane on wiki. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_massacre" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank';">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_massacre</a><!-- m -->

<br>In big cities in the uk there are problems with knives. Some schools want metal detectors, which I think is a good idea. And bullying certainly does exist. Children to my mind often have energy tho no innate morality or fear to guide them. I have carried anger with me for thirty plus years.

<br>With asperger its just about impossible to generate physical aggression. Perhaps thats why ball games, football is incomprehensible to an asperger kid. 'Games' were hell. Ten years of being the last man to ever be picked, standing there like a spare end. Bastards. 
<br>
<br>It to me it  is a sense of 'wateryness' difficult to describe tho a fellow sufferer will know what I mean. The existing literature in my opinion is still quite crude. No-one can describe the life I've lead.

<br>I was reading a book on early aviators a few minutes ago, Wilbur and Orville Wright could well have been aspie. Not a conclusive diagnosis, tho worthy of consideration.

<br>Comments please.
