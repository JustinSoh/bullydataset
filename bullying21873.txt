				Hey Willow,
<br>I'm not going to go into much detail about my experience with bullying on here because I have already posted it in 2 different posts in this forum. If you would like to read up on my experience and what my advice is, please read "bullying in the classroom" in this forum. 
<br>My advice for you is to tell a school official, principal, vice principal, teacher, etc. Someone who had authority in school. They would probably be more than obliged to help you out! 
<br>I'm always here if you need to talk.
<br>
<br>~Jamie~
