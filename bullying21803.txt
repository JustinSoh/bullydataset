				Haha, yeah I know.
<br>
<br>
<br>Okay! Since there was little time to talk and little time in the hallways to talk in... I had ALMOST no bullying today. However most of it happened in my fifth hour and I had been REALLY depressed. Why I'm so happy started with sixth hour.
<br>
<br>My sixth hour teacher starts taking attendance right? So she goes Michael.. A-lastname-
<br>
<br>Then she looks at me and goes "YOU!! I KNOW YOU! I MET YOU YESTERDAY!!" And just her silliness made me happy to be there.
<br>
<br>She had us laughing the whole time, not a second was boring. It was the bomb. She called a kid named Dakota "South Dakota" because he was a little man! XDDD 
<br>
<br>She's the exact opposite of my fourth hour teacher. My fourth hour teacher sounded like this:
<br>
<br>Whomp whomp, whomp whomp whomp whooommmppp.
<br>
<br>He talked in a monotanous tone and repeated everything 10 times in 10 minutes. Which I found funny, since the smart people get everything much faster than the... "smartness challenged" and he's the smart math teacher! LOL 
<br>
<br>I was pwn at my locker, I got it my second try <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"> And that was only because I didn't hear my teacher say "First number go left, second number go right, last number go left." So I figured it out on my own!
<br>
<br>Woot woot! <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy"> my sixth hour teacher makes me feel important too, so it's all good. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy">
