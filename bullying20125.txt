				hi there, dont worry I definately know how you feel. I was bullyed mostly throughout my highschool years, sometimes even by the whole class. I now feel paranoid, and scared of other people. But the truth is you cant let the past hit you. If people at work are still doing this to you than speak up! its not you, its them. Belive in yourself. My best tip for you is to see a counciler about it, it helped me throughout my anxiety.
