				There are two main forms of bullying:
<br>
<br>
<br>--&gt; Bullying due to a physical feature (Scar, burn-mark, birth-mark)
<br>This can lead to the individual becoming very self-aware about the feature in question.  Over time, paranoia may develop (That people are staring at them) and thus make them anxious when around people.
<br>
<br>--&gt; Bullying due to the way a person acts
<br>This can decrease a person's confidance in how they live their life.  It can lead to non-social interaction and through time they will become anxious around people due to lack of interaction.
