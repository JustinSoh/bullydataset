				autonomy.  you are not part of others and they are not part of you.  
<br>
<br>if people want to bully you that has everything to do with them and nothing to do with you.
<br>
<br>why would somebody NEEDING to bully another have anything to do with you? 
<br>
<br>that NEED is their need not yours.
<br>
<br>you have nothing to do with their need.  
<br>
<br>your needs have nothing to do with them.
<br>
<br>perhaps the best question is - why would i NEED to put so much emphasis on people bullying me?  does it threaten my idea of survival?  does it affect the way i see myself?  
<br>
<br>what need of mine is being threatened by bullying?  
<br>
<br>i work in a place where i might be the target of bullying.  
<br>
<br>but i don't need them so i don't feel threatened by it.
<br>
<br>although i do grow tired of it and it gives me ideas of how to do things differently.
