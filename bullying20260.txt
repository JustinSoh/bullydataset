Some kids just pick on anyone who is different in any way. You're right, there will always be people making fun of others who are different. Thanks but I guess there will always be a part of me that will be ashamed for not standing up for myself. I hadn't been in a fight before either. I wish I was because one kid kept challenging me. One time he mocked me and challenged me right on my front stoop. Instead of accepting and standing up for myself I ran inside to my mother. My mother berated me so badly for being such a coward. I know I totally deserved it. I know how ashamed she must have been to have such a coward for a son. I cried for almost an hour. It was my fault. If I had just stood up for myself instead of running. That's why I mean I was a coward. I wish I could go back and change things but I can't.</div></blockquote><br>I know how you feel I wish I could change what happens to me but I can't but what we can do now is make sure know else bully us again do you have any idea why you didn't stand up for yourself  I don't really know why I didn't do it maybe I was to scared of what might happen if I did I never had to fight so that could be part of it two maybe I was scared to take a beating when I was like 8 there was this boy that always take my toys and wouldn't give them back one day my mom told if I didn't hit him she was gonna spank me well I had him hit he went home crying told his sister. She was like 20she came talk to my mom she told her to get back home or she get some. Of what he got well he never took my toys away from me  anymore</div></blockquote><br><br><br>See I actually wish I could have did something to make kids stop picking on me like you did.  When you hit that kid he learned his lesson and stopped bothering you.  I think pretty much the reason I didn't stand up for myself was that I was scared.  I was scared of getting beat up.  I don't know why I was so scared I was never really beat up.  I was just pushed around and tripped and stuff a lot.  I was very short and small for my size so I knew physically I wouldn't win.  Also part of me felt that I deserved to be pushed around and bullied because I was a coward for not standing up for myself.  I expected it.  I felt pretty worthless.  It all turned into a cycle.  Kids picked on me, I was too scared to stand up for myself.  I felt weak.  I was seen as weak.  More kids picked on me because I was such a wimp.  I expected it and accepted it.  I didn't do anything to stop it so it continued like a cycle all the time I felt worse and worse about myself until I didn't really care anymore.  Did you ever feel anything like that?</div></blockquote><br>Yeah I did feel that same way  I went to comprehensive care for about a year because I didn't want to go to  school I rode the short bus we got there at 8 am and got out at 11am then they told us that we were gonna have to go to school till 3pm and that they would take us to the school we would ride the big bus home I knew that I would get bully again so I quit school did you ever take a look at my post in the abuse and incest forums yet
