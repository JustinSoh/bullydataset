				Hi Giulia,<br><br>Please carefully read the following suggestion and give such connotation your highest consideration.  <br><br><span style="font-style: italic">Recommendation</span><br><br>Start from scratch with a new doctor. <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Start anew</span></span>. Let it be a <span style="text-decoration: underline">new beginning</span>. Deal with present-day issues with a brand new doctor and do not focus nor address the conduct of past doctors (not advantageous; it may open a can of worms). Let It Be… Let It Be (just like that wonderful Beatles song). Concentrate on current issues and look ahead towards your new beginning with hope. Hope breeds positive expectations.   <br> <br>It is okay to be somewhat assertive, but, try not to be <span style="text-decoration: underline">overly</span> assertive because unknowingly, without any forthright intend, you may inadvertently come across a bit <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">adversarial and say things</span></span> that are not conducive for nurturing an amicable and fruitful relationship with a doctor. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">MORE IMPORTANTLY</span></span>, strategically, the best way to win a doctor right from the beginning is to show <span style="text-decoration: underline">immediate</span> kindness and politeness intertwined with respect and gratitude for service rendered. Let the doctor know upon <span style="text-decoration: underline">introduction</span> that you appreciate what he or she will do for you; that he or she renders invaluable service to the community (small talk)… that’s how I get my physicians in my corner, and thus, more interested in my wellbeing (a win-win situation for both parties). Giulia, this is how respect is earned. If you treat people like garbage with disrespect, they will treat you like garbage with disrespect as well. This is a universal concept, which also applies to doctors, so it is to your best interest to be nice to doctors because you are the one that needs help. You do not want to be miserable/despondent/downhearted for the rest of your life. Please, please, please, please, don’t dwell in the past and start with a new doctor with kindness and respect, which will put you in a healthy and solid relationship with your new doctor, a sound pathway towards remedying your current issues (that should be your goal).<br>   <br>I genuinely appreciate what doctors do for society (many years of dedication and preparation with the aim to help/heal others).  If it doesn’t work out with the new doctor, then, the problem is with your attitude and your perceptions towards doctors. Unfortunately, you will be miserable/despondent/downhearted for the rest of your life if you do not start taking accountability for your own actions, and thus, behavior. It doesn’t cost anything to be nice towards people including doctors. Show respect and please, I implore you with much exhortation don’t be adversarial towards your new doctor. Remember, the person that needs help is you. The person that needs to change is you, so try to control your assertiveness (clearly demonstrated throughout your writings, which have caused me great concern about your current state-of-mind). You need to find a doctor that you respect; otherwise, he or she will not be able to help you. And again, misery and correlating attributes will still linger in your life because you lost an opportunity to get better, so please, go out of your way to be extra nice to your new doctor; okay?  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br>  <br>By your manner of expression, I as an editor and somewhat considered highly educated by society standards, I can tell that you haven’t yet fully matured. But sometime in the future you will have the necessary tools for proper judicial discernment. For the time being, look deep within yourself as I do to myself, because there is much room for improvement. We can only improve ourselves after we are able to honestly identify our shortcomings. Trust me, you and I are imperfect beings; so let’s focus in ourselves only and not in other peoples’ shortcomings (including doctors). The focus is with self: A checkup from the neck-up.     <br>   <br>Remember the old saying: You can catch more flies with honey than vinegar. <br> <br>You may not be able to control 100% of your circumstances, but you CAN control 100% of your reaction to them, and reaction is everything, no? I think you get the gist. <br><br>NOTE: The last conceptual sentence may not be applicable to many people with mental issues, but, it would be a great goal for an individual to reach, hence, being able to control his or her reactions at will regardless of surrounding circumstances. Even people considered normal can’t control their reactions when facing nerve-racking circumstances. But the point is: reactionary control is important, which leads to civility. <br><br>All the best! And remember, Santa is watching. Happy Holidays!!  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br><br>Dr. B, PhD<br><br>P.S. Unintelligent response(s) will be ignored. Take what works for you.
