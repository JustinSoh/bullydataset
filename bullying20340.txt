				aww..  kids can be horrible at times and i'm really really sorry that (s)hes going through this.. school is almost the entire universe for a child <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"> <br><br>You've spoken to the school about this and what was their response if you have?<br>Clearly they need to keep a much closer eye on what's happening throughout the day there..  <br>if they refuse to do anything about it.. you can ask for a meeting with the headteacher to discuss the issue and if this doesn't help, you can escalate to the bullying officer at the local education department (or equivalent in your location/country).<br><br>What was the response of the parents of the child? <br><br>My child was also bullied throughout school and unfortunately, even after going through all the steps that I've mentioned to you.. I had to remove mine from school and get another school sorted out.<br>Hopefully you can get this settled long before this point though.<br><br>Also..   a really helpful idea is to make sure that your child has activities outside school so that their confidence doesn't take too much damage..    maybe scouts/guides/tae-kwon-do/boxing/some variety of club..<br><br>sending gentle hugs to both of you <br><br>xx
