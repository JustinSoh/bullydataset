				Hi, ONAMERICANSOIL! Welcome to the forum. I'm sorry this is happening to your son. Other kids should stand up for him.
<br> Maybe it would be easyer for him to tell you what's going on if you talked to him and tried to listen if he acts out, instead of punishing him. I know that discipline is important, but he shouldn't feel too intimidated to tell you about what is happening at school right away.
