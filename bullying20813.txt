				Oh man this is really sad.<br><br>I can kind of relate in parts, so it's kind of painful to watch/hear.<br><br>It's clear to see the guy is a jerk and most probably has mental/personality issues. But what is sad is wanting to understand what he was doing and if he really cared about you. It sounds like you can't handle the fact that he may not have even given a %##@ about you and you can't stand to know that. Forget the fact that he was an absolute creep. You gotta ask yourself why you are so wrapped up in a guy who treated you so badly, who you only met a few times (and only saw you on his terms) and you seemed more concerned about the fact that "did I mean something to him?". <br><br>I get it though, because I got treated similar (not as bad) but when it was over all I wanted to know in my mind was "did he even give a %#%^ about me at all?" and I couldn't handle the truth, to know that it was all just a little game and he was bored and I was around . But the truth is he probably didn't give a crap, or I was on a very low priority on his list of "cares". Luckily I am not naturally one to run and persist (although I did a little bit, which I thought was rather sad of me and was unusual), but eventually I blocked and said "that's it". Unfortunately, I still have ruminating thoughts about the whole thing, but I know this is something I have to work on and this is my issues and the relationship just brought things out about myself that I was not aware of.<br><br>So really you can't do anything about him, but all you can do is work on yourself. And if you are anything like me, it's about low self-esteem and insecurities. You will repeat the pattern again and again, if you don't work on yourself!  If you had self confidence and were secure in yourself, you would not let a guy like this string you along. You would of in fact blocked him the moment you noticed strange behavior. Good luck!
