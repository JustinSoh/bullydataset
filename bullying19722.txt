				i think bullying in all areas isn't ever going to go away ,as much as i would love to see it go .cyber bullying is a growing concern &amp; sadly feel it will get worse,this needs to be more &amp; more policed,how i  don't know? but somthing on the same level as every day to day policing ,this MAY help reduce it? gun crime is also another issue. but have to say have never witnessed it myself thankfully &amp; hope to never have to. how to deal with gun crime i have to say ,have no idea .but know ,sadly any crime in this country or overseas will never go away completely ,the best we will ever get if we are likely is crime reduction ,if we can all work together to provent it ,the police alone i dobt will do that.shame really.
