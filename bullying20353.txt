				Hi there.  Thanks you two for responding.  Yes my therapist and I have addressed the different circles of interaction.  I don't get your last sentence.  Can you please explain what you mean by 75 people aren't emotionally close enough to you to hurt you?  Do you mean they know nothing about you and therefore have nothing to criticize?  Because it seems like I can get hurt by anyone's bullying.
