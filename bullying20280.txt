				Ok....I think the idea of locking up a child and declaring terrorists goes a bit towards the extreme. I think these children need help though before they grow older and get into situations that warrant lock up or leave them no better then a terrorist. like w/ this 3rd grader the thread is about.....doesn't it concern anyone WHY this child acts out in this manner of choking another child to this degree????? Don't you wonder what is going on in this child's home life???? That needs looking into...and if not anything in the child's homelife that would cause this....some form of abuse or the way the child is raised....then possibly some psycological issues going on where this child needs treatment. You can't treat a child like an adult even for those adult actions. The child needs to be punished...but you also need to look at this child's individual situation and find out just where this type of expression is coming from. Children are this way for a reason and that reason needs to be dealt w/. You can't just lock them up and forget them....problem solved. Eventually ...in our society...they will be set free...and if just left there untreated...what are we then unleashing into society???? Society has a bit of responsiblity here too at that point. But in the short term...this school and his parents are WAY OFF BASE...trying to pretend a problem doesn't exist where it does. The parents don't want to accept the truth and the school wants to push it under the rug and move on. You are hurting way more then just the child w/ issue here...you are creating future victims.
