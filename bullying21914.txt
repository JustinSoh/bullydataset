If I choose not to like a race, I am allowed to do so, provided that I do not persecute those of that race. <br>If you are going to websites and telling people that they shouldn't do certain things then you are the one who is attempting to bully them. What gives you the right to decide what they should and shouldn't watch? <br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div> People on most of those sites wrote back just to make fun of my race. The sad thing is, I think most of these people were adults in their 20s. They were just cracking really immature and racist jokes like they were in junior high school. </div></blockquote><br><br>Many people are immature - it's a fact of life. <br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I wonder if they're brave enough to do that in real life. <br><br>I wonder what drives people to do these sorts of things.</div></blockquote><br><br>Possibly - maybe the same mentality that drives people to create an intimidating presence to make up for personal inscurities. Or maybe you disagree, "Predator"?
