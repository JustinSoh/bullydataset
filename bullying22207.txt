				Terrific! Everyone knows about the aforementioned divine attributes (i.e., kindness, respect, old saying, and so on). But, not everyone is always successful in applying these magnificent principles effectively, hence, my response (or so called lecture as you <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">boldly</span></span> stated). <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br> <br>I don’t think sarcasm and being disrespectful and being overly assertive are considered divine attributes (even when provoked). Rise above it and don’t stoop to their level. <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">It doesn't make you any better of a person than the person doing the bullying</span></span>. Make a report if you wish and move on to another doctor. Just avoid the revolving door scenario. <br> <br>Start with a clean slate when you are ready.  <br> <br>The practical application of knowledge translates to wisdom, which is a good thing. Practical knowledge that is not applied is useless. So, there is a clear distinction between knowing something and NOT manifesting such knowledge, which leads to wisdom (i.e., producing positive results). I have a million dollars in my back packet (knowledge), but I don’t use it (knowledge not applied). I am still poor.  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"> <br><br>I recommend <span style="text-decoration: underline">carefully</span> rereading the responses provided in this thread. Good food for thought. <br><br>I sincerely wish you all the best! I mean each and every word.     <br><br>Most respectfully yours,<br>B
