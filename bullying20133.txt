				It's really difficult to keep a good attitude towards people when you're holding so much hurt from the past..   <br>but, i think if the attitude is holding you back from starting to trust some people - it's really worth looking at how you can start to carefully change things so you can join in and become part of society..<br><br>anger is a mixture of hurt, betrayal and sadness..  a few other emotions thrown into the mix as well -  anger isn't a pure emotion like sadness - it's an amalgamation.<br>Your anger sounds like it's there to protect you from further hurt and I can understand that -  I closed down for a long time.. kept people at arms length - though i didn't feel much anger towards society as a whole - i simply felt confused and wary..  <br>I'm starting to step out into the world again and trust a bit - it is possible but it takes a lot of time..<br>I can't promise all your hurt will go away but yes..  you can heal from it to a huge degree if you do it carefully over time.
