				Hello Lunar Drop<br>I am so sorry to hear what you are having to put up with all that you are going through.<br>You need support for yourself, if you are able to speak with your parent(s), I suggest that you do.  If for any reason you can't, then perhaps another relative.  No wonder you are feeling angry.  I would imagine that you must be feeling very isolated, frightened, and exhausted not knowing when it is going to end.<br><br>You need an adult to inquire from the school if they have a "Bullying Policy", and if so, ask to see it so that you know the procedure to follow.   <br>From what you say, you are being bullied in several different ways, for example<br>Verbal Bullying             (the things they are saying to and about you).<br>Physical Bullying           (sticky tape in your hair) <br>Gesture Bullying           (the way they intimidate and frighten you (even if it is just in a look).<br>Exclusion Bullying          (isolating you from your friends, which can attacks your self confidence)  <br><br>Not wanting to tell anybody is a sign of your anxiety or distress.  It sounds as if you are afraid that you will loose your temper and do something that may have you in trouble, and it would.  Naturally enough, you are dreading going into school each day, I would be afraid that if this continues that it will effect your school work, which you may regret later.<br><br>Be careful about hitting out at the bullies, you may get hurt if they gang up on you, but what may be even worse, the bullies may report you to the head teacher, saying that you are the bully.  Make sure not to fall into that trap.<br><br>Bullies like to get a reaction, there is no point in them bullying you if they can't get to you.  Not letting them see how much they worry you sometimes makes them turn to another person to bully.  But looking cool is a very hard thing to do when so distressed.  They are the ones with the problem, not you.  They need to be stopped once and for all....put on a written warning.<br><br>Please talk to your parents if you can, or someone in your family.  Failing that tell your teachers, ask your friends to accompany you and support you.  It is good that you have come to this forum, but you need to talk out verbally to someone, someone who can do something about the situation.  <br><br>I am a therapist, and I work in a school.  If a student came to me asking for my help, I would make sure to bring the problem out into the open with the head teacher, and the other staff members.  I  would encourage that child to inform their parents so that they would have more support, and suggest that they ask the school about their bullying policy for handling the problem.  Have you asked your counsellor to look at the ways you could deal with this situation?  Talking is something you can do when this is all over, and you may want to then, but right now you need POSITIVE ADULT ACTION!!<br><br>In the meantime, It would be a good idea to keep a record of any incident that have happens.  Write only the facts: who, what, when, how etc.  This form of "whistle blowing" you should do because it is wrong that it is happening to you, or any other pupil.<br>Make sure to tell what has happened,  Who is doing it, How often it has happened, Did anyone see or hear what went on, and what you tried to take action by talking to your  counsellor.  <br><br>There is no such thing as a bully-free school, but schools should do all that they can to prevent it happening and getting out of control.....it is their responsibility to make the school environment as safe as possible for every student and staff member.  If the school does not have a Bully Policy, then it is time that they drew one up.  But remember, they cannot help you if they do not know what is happening to you.  I understand that you hate making a fuss, but you need help, your anxiety has gone too far to be able to ignore those brats.  You are not being dramatic.  You have a right to be able to go to school and learn, you should not have to put up with being intimidated .......this goes against Health and Safety Regulations. <br><br>I am glad to hear that you are serious, because bullying is a very serious business.  Take that "seriousness" and get a team together to sort this mess out once and for all.  I don't think it will happen, but If the school do not take your complaint seriously, then perhaps it is time to move to a more responsible school where you can be allowed to do your studies and achieve your goals so that you can follow your dream to have a career in Astronomy.<br><br>Hope this is some help.  Remember, you don't have to stay slient and put up with this terrible situation.
