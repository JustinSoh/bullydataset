				I have dealt with this issue a lot in regards to a double standard in therapist-patient relationships. I noticed when I was in therapy that any tension or misunderstanding that came up between me and my therapists was attributed to my emotional problems only as if the therapists' own emotional issues didn't contribute in any way.<br><br>In regards to Asians, I agree, there is an unspoken double standard that comes up often when there is an inter-racial conflict between blacks and Asians. Just recall this whole Linsanity story with Jeremy Lin. Somehow racists remarks against him were ok while they wouldn't have been tolerated if they'd been thrown at any other NBA player. <br><br>WM
