				I wouldn't consider this type of bullying strange, since you could get in more trouble when you punch someone in the face than when you throw insults at someone.<br><br>Ooh... I hate it when people discriminate Asians (well, actually, I hate it when anyone discriminates a race).<br><br>I don't want to be the one who tells people to only hang around with their own race, but do you have any Asian friends? It helps to stay in a group with people who have something in common with you. If not, find some other close friends who will stand up for you.<br><br>In my opinion, I think people don't care when people make racist comments at an Asian because some of the Asian stereotypes are considered "positive", though those can have as much negative impact as any other stereotype. But if you fit some of those stereotypes, act like you're proud of it because people assuming that you're smart is better than the other way around.<br><br>I'd actually love to do a protest against Asian discrimination. But I'd rather do one online because I'd raise some eyebrows in real life since the majority of people where I live are Asian...<br><br>Sorry if this didn't help much, I'm not all that good with advice. But just know that I have an idea of where you're coming from. I've been picked on several times for being Asian, just not to a huge extent.
