				Hey again,
<br>
<br>You 'used to' do creative writing?  I also used to... ...but not anymore.  I don't appear to have the patience for it now.   Wow, I can't believe that you're the youngest of 4 daughters and I'm the youngest of four sons!  Plus, you get on better with guys and I get on better with girls.  Plus, we obviously have similar mental problems to deal with ( <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad"> ).
<br>
<br>
<br>Kevin.
