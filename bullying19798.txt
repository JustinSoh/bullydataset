				Tell your manager the problems of the world mostly aren't due to oversensitive people, they are due to insensetive people. It's incredibly juvenile of her to attack you the bullying victim, and defend the bully, you are not the one with a problem here. Find a way to contact the head of the business chain you work for, and report your boss to them. <br><br>Your boss may be a bully, and is unable to relate to someone who has their empathy skills intact. Just try to go above them as much as you can, or as a last resort threaten to get the courts involved. You are not the person who is wrong in any way regarding this situation. You're just a good person, unfortunately in the position of being under the thumb of a bully boss in control. It seems to me the boss favors your tormentor, because they are both sick in the same way.<br><br>Also nothing irritates me more than someone saying something is wrong with people who are oversensitive. I was told that I was oversensitive throughout my time in public school, I'm 28 now. I truly think those who bully are sociopaths, and while some may be able to realize their sickness and find help for it, many don't and even claim the normal people with empathy are the sick ones just to avoid what monsters they've become
