				I've tried everything, I have written down what they said, but they don't believe me. This school is supposed to have a Zero Tolerance policy on bullying, yet they haven't done $#%^ but talk to them, which then got them off the hook pretty much. I've tried everything to get my point across to how much it's hurting me. But they don't listen. No one. None of the teachers, not the principal, parents won't take action, the secretaries don't do anything, nor do the lunchmoms, I have no one but me to take action. Taking matters into my own hands would end up in about 100 murders, so I'm not going to take actions into my own hands. I'm moving to a new school which also has a zero tolerance policy [from elementary to middle school] on bullying, so let's hope this one works out better for me.
