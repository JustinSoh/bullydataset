				Dear capsulecorp:<br><br>From your quotes and descriptions, it is clear that this man should be rejected from the site and any other public site. He is clearly a bully, abusive and bad news. <br><br>Problem is you are afraid to lose your job and I don't have advice for how you can do the right thing AND not lose your job. I don't know what it takes to keep the job... tolerating this guy is a precondition to keeping the job?<br><br>If he is like a cult leader with minions, it means to me that he is displaying what others are considering power, strength. And people, like herd animals, look up to power, admire power. Isn't this why an aggressive person has way more chances to achieve a high position, let's say in government, even become president than a passive, submissive person, regardless of intelligence, skill, experience, values and all else? <br><br>Your partner moderator with the degree may very well be one of the many people who admire any kind of display of power.<br><br>What do you think?<br><br>atina
