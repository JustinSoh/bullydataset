				I was bullied in Jr. High, the other girls found me really weird and just annoying. They would have loud discussions within earshot of me, to make sure I heard them. They would steer clear of me, if I went somewhere they would all move away, like I was carrying some horrible illness or something. In short, school was horrible, I hated it, I went home from school feeling miserable every day. I am a social and extroverted person, which didn't help.<br><br>I'm so over it now. I realized that it wasn't something worth holding onto, I chose to let it go. I had an outlet at the time which I know helped. <br><br>Did sharing it here help you let any of it go?
