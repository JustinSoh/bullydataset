				Hey,
<br>I just thought I'd reply to this really quick. I'm 17 as well and have been bullied for as long as I can remember because I was always the new girl. Even after being in the same school system for going on 9 years now, I'm still continuously bullied, but never to the extent that you have been. Most of the bullying to me is verbal. I do know what it's like to be bullied though. I used to dread going to school, and I do again now that I know there's a few other people in my school that are starting to bully me. 
<br>If you need to talk, feel free to add me to MSN, my addie should be in my profile, if not pm me and I'll send it to you.
<br>
<br>~Jamie~
