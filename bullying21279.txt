				Paul you might not like this interpretation, but give me a chance, it may help you in coping in the future.<br><br>Lets pretend for a minute that she wasn't an abuser.<br><br>Lets say you were working together, and the boss had asked her to help you out if she needed it.<br><br>She saw that you were quite busy, juggling a number of tasks, and she knew she should help out.<br><br>However, she is not sure how to jump in and do the tasks, so she is quite anxious about it.<br><br>She tries to cover her anxiety by trying to sound authoritative and the result is the voice that you described.<br><br>The sound of her voice triggered some bad memories in you.<br><br>Also, her being authoritative was inappropriate because you are the one who knows your job best.<br><br>And so feeling that you are being targeted, you respond quite defensively.<br><br>Instead of saying "It's okay, I got this".<br><br>Either way she wouldn't have liked being told to back down.  But if she makes no further challenge, then you have asserted your position successfully.<br>The two of you were engaging in a negotiation for the balance of power, which is a normal workplace situation.<br><br>If you decide to interpret her manner as 'abusive' then it will start that internal dialogue in you, of anxiety and of fear of threat, your memories will resurface, you will feel powerless.<br><br>If you think 'she is just anxious herself because she doesn't know what to do, I will assert my boundaries and reassure her with my tone of voice'.<br><br>Realise that you might be feeling a lot of emotions but that you can overpower that feeling and get control.
