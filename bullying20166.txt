				OMG, I totally understand what your going through, as a sophmore in highschool, I am currently being target a lot, and always have been from a young age... what makes things worse is that I have anger issuses so when I do tend to get extremely aggrivated and angry, I turned into this whole other person for the remainder of the day...<br><br>I suggest just vent your feelings out in a healthy way to avoid getting hurt or trouble.. my helpful but weak method is just crying it out... I may appear weak to the bullies but they better be glad im crying and not pounding their face <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation">
