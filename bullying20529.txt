				I agree with Ashlar that if the school itself refuses to do anything (or even acknowledge the problem) it is time that you stop beating your head against the wall and seek other avenues where you might get more of a response. Switching schools is of course an option as you mentioned, especially if your son does not feel comfortable in his current surroundings. Of course in that particular situation, the responsible parties are not held responsible.
