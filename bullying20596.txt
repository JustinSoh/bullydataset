				I wanted to suggest that you get as much help for your son as you can find out about this bullying and what mental damages it can cause. I was bullied all of my life, i'm now 30 years old and have numerous problems, that I cannot find the answer to, and my life is destroyed.
<br>
<br> This is a <span style="font-weight: bold">serious</span> problem in society. And I know people say, "well they are only kids" but I feel that these kids should be "locked up" (yes, I said locked up) regardless of their age. They are <span style="font-weight: bold">terrorists </span>and no different and destroy multiple lives throughout their lifetimes.
<br>
<br> So try (for your son's sake) (as I feel sure that you are) to discover what problems this will cause him in life and try to rectify those problems at this early age.
