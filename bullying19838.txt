				30 people seems like an enormous number to me.  I interact with about 10 people in real life.  But have online contact with everyone else.  So I'm biased in anything I write!  <br><br>Has your counsellor talked about different circles of interaction?  People you'd say hi to if you saw them in the street.  People you might call up to go to a movie.  People you trust to talk about personal issues with.  People you could call at 2am if you needed to.  100 people in the "hi" category seems possible.  75 people in the category of "emotionally close enough to be hurtful if they bullied you" seems a lot.
