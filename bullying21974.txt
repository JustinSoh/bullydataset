				This is something that I would truly support, dedicating my time too. As someone who was viciously bullied in school to the point of wanting to die, and still having lingering side effects in the form of PTSD to this day, stopping bullying in schools should be the first priority in any school. <br><br><br>Bullying is a complex subject, often misunderstood with many misconceptions. Any kind of bullying harms the entire student community. Not just the victim, but everyone else too. Some students will become a bully or join the bully(s) just to avoid being picked on. Bullies create a hostile controlling environment that everyone can notice. Being so common or not being taken care of by the school can lead students to believe bullying is ok or not worthy of being stopped.<br><br><br>How to stop bullying is not easy, but it might be as simple as teaching kids not to do it in the first place. When I was young me and a group of kids would pick on an overweight girl at school. At the time I had no idea it was wrong, even though it made her clearly upset. The teacher would dismiss it. Looking back I think what would have been right is having the teacher sit down and explain what we were doing was wrong and why, in a respectable way. I am sure I would have stopped afterward. But because no adult told me otherwise I and those group of kids believed teasing was ok. <br><br><br>Which leads me to believe why some parents blame the target. Its safe to say parents who condone bullying took part in the same type of behavior as kids themselves without anyone telling them otherwise. To those parents it looks like normal childhood behavior, so its easy to make the statement the victim is being over protected. Of course what they do not see is the amount of pain and suffering the victim is in, and this is where the problem arises. <br><br><br>Schools (at least here in the US) are so fixated on testing and academics that they fail to address far more important aspects like bullying. Every school has bullies, and ever school has victims along with students who witness it. Educating students, and getting both chronic bullies and victims help is essential. I always hear people saying victims need help, and they do, but what about chronic bullies? Students who have a constant desire to bully by all means have an underlying problem what ever that may be.   <br><br>Anti-bully programs help, but in truth the entire school policy needs to change if we really wanted to help. A 30 minute assembly no matter how emotional will not change anything for more than 15 minutes. Heck Ive even seen bullying take place during anti-bullying lessons. In one of them we had to shake hand with everyone else. A girl who was a known bully would roll hers eyes or say "Im only doing this because we have to" at people she would repeatedly target. Of course something more needs to be done.
