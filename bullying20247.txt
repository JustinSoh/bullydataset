				I experienced a similar thing when i was at school.  I am a man and my name is Kerry.  For quite a while when i was growing up i desperately wanted to change my name.  It wasn't just fellow students who caused me problems.  There was one teacher who was covering our lesson who almost refused to return my work to me because he didn't believe that that was my name.  Now however i don't. I like my name.  I like the fact that it is quite unique.  Yes there are still occasions where people double take when they hear my name, convinced that they must have heard it wrong.  If i've ever needed an ID badge for a school or something (I'm a part time teacher), the number of times the school didn't check and just assumed and i got badges with Miss instead of Mr.  I was also bullied and not just verbal for other reasons as well.  I didn't fight back against any of it.  I just ignored it publicly while inside it was destroying me to the point where now i have a very cynical and world weary view of the world and people.  I bury it all a lot of the time, but that's a different issue.  <br><br>One thing to think about.  The adult world is much accepting of names.  They (mostly) have the maturity just to accept what your name is without question.  One thing i would like to know.  Is it just becasue of the bullying that you don't like your name?  If it is just that then why should you have to change your name?  Why should silly immature ******* force you to change something about yourself.<br><br>Too be honest i can't really give you advice.  The teacher in me would say all sorts of things, but i know from what you have said and also from what i experienced myself that you won't act on any of that.  <br><br>The bullies are looking for a reaction from you.  I'm not saying that if you give them nothing they will stop, because that's a load of rubbish.  What they will do is continue to see if they can push you over the edge.  I doubt very much this will give you any comfort at the moment, but the bullying won't last forever and eventually you may develop the strength and the resolve just to think to yourself.  'They're taking the p*** out of me because of my name.  Can't they think of anything more original than that?'
