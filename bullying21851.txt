Such an evil crime, why would anyone resort to such an extremely horrible crime? After I was done with high school, I think I found a few individuals along the way, that I wouldn't have been entirely opposed to serving a 25 to life prison sentence in exchange for snuffing out their life, preferably by choking them to death.</div></blockquote><br><br>I actually got into physical confrontations but other people don't feel pain like I thought they did. They mostly just stare in my face with a giant smile, even when their eyes are blood red. They know exactly what I'm afraid of and they spend the rest of the time, blood red eyes, trying to destroy me.
