				Do you mean well adjusted to a new life after traumas?<br><br>Hugs received!<br><br>I had flashbacks today.<br>Eriko wrote me an email the last November, the day after our birthday.<br>She wrote to me if I don't fix my distorted personality, I will be alone in my entire life.<br>She cursed me...<br>That was the last e-mail she gave me...<br><br>I don't think that I am distorted.<br>I think my twin is distorted in her thinking to have made a choice to sexually abuse me after traumas.<br>I think I am straight in my thinking not to have made a choice to sexually abuse her after traumas.<br><br>I had the flashbacks today 'cause the landlords gave a notice of eviction to me the last night. The reason is 'cause they are going to use my suite. It's reasonable, but when people try to get rid of me, it reminds me of my family. I have been cursed and been bullied within my family. I ran away from my family, but I miss my house and home town. I feel relieved to be away from my family, but why did I have to run away? I was the one who made a good choice, and my family did not! My family should have left the house instead of my leaving. Why did the one who made the right choice have to leave and give up the house where I grew up? <br><br>gosh... I am feeling upset.<br><br>I feel isolated during the flashbacks; but I know there are people who give me hugs <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink">
