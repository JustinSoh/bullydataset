				I agree with Ada and OverwhelmedFear 100% on this.<br><br>Leaving someone is not a way to teach them a lesson, it's inappropriate, immature, degrading, disrespectful, distasteful, abusive and down right nasty on your part and by having that attitude you're only stooping down to her low level and there really is no need for that..<br><br>I too support you leaving this relationship and I think you should stop engaging in any game playing with her and leave as soon as possible but be honest with her when you break up with her and if she explodes just walk away and do not look back, if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe then make sure you have someone waiting outside for you and walk away with them because you then have a witness if she pulls any crazy stunts.<br><br>At the end of the day you're a 21 year old grown <span style="font-weight: bold">adult</span> and she's a 16 year old kid and stooping down to her level is an immature and stupid move on your part, do whatever is right for you and be a real man about it.<br><br>Sel<br><blockquote><div><cite>Ada wrote:</cite><blockquote><div><cite>CJC1992 wrote:</cite>I'm waiting for her to explode with rage once again and then I'll teach her a lesson by leaving her like everyone does.</div></blockquote><br>That's abusive, CJC.  Nothing that she's done justifies your retaliation.  If you choose to leave [and I support that] then please consider doing it with dignity.  It's not a "lesson", you aren't her teacher or therapist.  You'll make a much more powerful impact over time by treating her with respect in this difficult situation.  And by showing that you have self-respect in this too.</div></blockquote>
