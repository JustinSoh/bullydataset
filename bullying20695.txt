				Hi,<br><br>I have known people in the past who were kind of rude or aggressive but here's the story of a guy I've been living with for 2 months. I have NO idea what his deal is, but hes becoming more of a bully at an insane pace. I am currently on a waiting list to get out of my lease. I didnt know the guy before but he was friends with my 2 other roommates that I knew, and I cant believe they wanted to live with him. Trigger warning, some of the quotes by him may offend some readers.<br><br>I am 21 and moved into an apartment to go to my new college. One of my 3 other roommates is almost a decade older than me. Hes a marine who was overseas for a few tours and had an abusive childhood, even recently changing his last name because of it. When I first got here he was overly enthusiastic to hang out and co-habitate well. Quickly I realized he behaves like a narcissist and thinks he is Gods gift to all people. Whatever, thats fine, no ones perfect.<br><br>As he became more comfortable with me he began calling me "#######1" and "pussy" fairly often. He seems to consider this "messing around" but its just off putting and kind of awkward. Im way younger than him and I just think its immature and useless behavior. On top of that he will always pull out my leg hairs if I sit near him, knock video game controllers out of my hand, turn off my computer if Im doing work, and will come grab food Im eating and put it in his mouth. All of this to him seems to be some form of "messing around" but it is now so frequent that it may comprise 100% of our interactions.<br><br>Early into our time living together, I brought a girl back to our apartment from one of my classes, to hang out and do whatever. My bully roommate became visibly jealous, and did the best he could to put on a show for her. He would try to both slander me and build himself up in front of her, but in a very embarrassing way for himself, and the girl actually told me she would hang with me, but never wanted to come back to m y apartment and see that guy. He has done this every time anyone brings a girl around here, and 100% of the time scares them away. Then he will think that theyre in love with him, and text them creepy things or try and get super touchy if he sees them again somewhere. All in all he is just very forward with women and ignores any boundaries they may have with him, but when one of his friends is interacting well with a woman, it pisses him off to no end and he does anything he can to sabotage it.<br><br>This same roommate has all of these things potentiated when he has been drinking. Last week we went to a bar where our server had pink hair, and this roommate made a disparaging remark to her about how it looked weird. She explained that she does it to support her mom with cancer, and one week prior she had found out she needed a double masectomy of her own due to cancer. MY roommate could not stifle his laughter. He laughed very hard at her and turned to me and made fun of her hair again. She left crying and the bartender said he was cutting my roommate off. He got up mad and left angrily without paying. He later went on a rant about what a bitch he thought the girl was and said he didnt do anything wrong. <br><br>He loves to fight when hes drunk, and has gotten into physical altercations with everyone he lives with in our apartment, and he has started every one. When he wants to have a fist fight, and I do not, because I simply am not interested in constant physical altercations, he goes on for a while about a "pussy" I am. In his mind, if you are not trying to fight at all times, you are weak. He also likes to pick altercations if you have different preference in movies, music, video games etc. with him. Basically if you have a differing opinion ever, you are wrong, and he will make a big deal out of it. At any given time of the day, he wants people to drop what theyre doing and fight him, and if you dont he will become angry at you and berate you.<br><br>He recently took all of our shared silverware, our trashcan, and other things, and locked them in his room. He then accused me of stealing some stuff I did not ever steal, and wasnt even here during the weekend they went missing. Things are now incredibly tense, just today he walked into the house and this following conversation ensued.<br><br>Him: "Hey (My name)!"<br>Me: "What up?"<br>Him: "###$ pussy."<br>Me: "...okay"<br>Him: "###$ #######1."<br><br>Its just like this all day. The man has no friends at all and now wants to have issues with his roommates. The more I dont care about the stuff he says, and continue to make more friends and pay less attention to him in general, the worse it gets. I understand I could fight him or just mirror his aggressive behavior back at him, but I just seriously dont care about the man at this point. I dont even want to have to waste the time and energy of having his one sided bullying become a two-way conflict. I think I was one of very few people who hang out with him, and now I spend very little time at our apartment, and he seems to be alone, despite his belief that he is super social and popular, but still pushes me away and makes me want to know him less. <br><br>What is going on here??
