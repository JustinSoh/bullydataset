				I'm a 40 year-old man. I work in a nightclub where I've worked for the last 8 years as a bouncer. A female co-worker who I am fond of, and 6 years younger than me was just promoted to manager about a year ago. Before she was promoted, me and her got along well. She knows I am fond of her because I had told her so. I sent her a message on Facebook once saying I thought she was beautiful, smart, and it was a pleasure working with her. She told me to keep our relationship professional, so I never sent her another message. I've always given her compliments, and have never said anything inappropriate to her.     <br>          Even more recently, a female head bouncer who happens to be a lesbian started working at the club, and the two of them are inseparable. I've been noticing that the girl I was fond of, is making a lot of snide remarks directed at me. It became a daily occurrence that she would make demeaning jokes directed at me. I have a receding hairline, and twice she came near me with the lesbian next to her and said to her "who am I," while cupping her hand over her hairline. Another time she came close me and took out her phone with it angled so I could not see, and showed the lesbian a picture. She asked the lesbian: "who does this look like?" They both looked at me, then started laughing. Later, a friend of mine showed me the picture, since they were sending it to everyone else in the club except me, and it was a picture of an unattractive man with a receding hairline. She would also be discourteous to me blatantly, like saying "good night, thank you." to the person standing next to me, but not to me. This has even become obvious to the other bouncers.<br>          I finally had enough, and emailed the owner of the club. Telling everything I just told you people here. Now I'm nervous that this girl will turn everything around on me, and deny everything. She might say I'm making this stuff up because I like her, and she turned me down. The point is, I've only given her compliments over the years, and never said anything inappropriate, and she has only responded with insults and attempts to humiliate me.<br>          I feel that letting her know I'm fond of her, gave her tremendous power over me. She knows she's in a position to hurt me emotionally and she exploited it. I'm no psychologist, but I feel she and her friend are on a power trip. She is known by the other staff to have a very poor personality, and is downright mean and rude- even to customers. She is extremely short (4'11'' or so), and she always talks about going to the range to shoot her guns (wtf?). She has completely changed for the worse. She even drinks now every night during work, which she never used to do. <br>         Anyway, I cannot stand working with her anymore. When she found out I emailed the owner with complaints, she called me yelling. She said "how dare you go over my head, and call the owner. I didn't do any of those things you said, you're a liar blah blab blah..."
