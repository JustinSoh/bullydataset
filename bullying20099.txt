<br>Problem with psychological warfare is that it can seriously backfire. A kid that went to my jr high thought he was gonna be slick and try that. Ended up with a broken rib from having the $#%^ kicked out of him. His plan ended up infuriating the bully even more and led to a worse beating than if he had done nothing.
