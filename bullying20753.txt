				It's a fair comment and one that people seem to go to as an easy-out option.<br><br>What is also true is that bullies usually rely on intimidation to do their job; hoping to avoid a direct confrontation. <br><br>Having exhausted the usual channels of talking to a person in authority to try to resolve the issues, I would encourage those who are being bullied to fight. <br><br>You will get hurt, you will probably lose the fight but you will inflict some damage on the way down. <br>Bruises heal and the chance of the bully seeing you as an easy target in the future will be slim.<br><br>Winning a fight is not about who is stronger or bigger; it's about who has no limits.
