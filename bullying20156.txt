				The "why target you?" very rarely has a good answer, I think.  You might remind him of someone he used to know.  Or he might see something of himself in you.  Or see something that he lacks but wishes he had [a skill, talent or personality trait.]  It might be he's massively insecure and someone complimented you in front of him.  I appreciate it's hard to handle when the behaviour is directed at you.  But it's not about you, it is about him.  <br><br>Is there someone in charge overall that you could speak to about it?  It doesn't have to be a formal complaint or anything that might cause you trouble in your working relationships.  But perhaps a quiet "is there an issue, I seem to have offended X somehow?" might help.  If he's known for having had issues before, perhaps there's a "procedure" in place for reminding him that he too needs to be professional about his relationships.  Or else it just flags up a little evidence in case this gets worse.  Though I sincerely hope it doesn't, of course.
