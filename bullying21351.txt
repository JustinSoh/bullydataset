				Yes, this is a good place to share.  And I'm glad you were able to.  What happened to you was truly awful.  <br><br>I wouldn't write off "getting ordained and having a ministry" as doing very little.  I've been told it involves significant amounts of work and love.  Good for you for doing that!  Do you have other forms of support now?  Either through your church or through a secular therapist?  And friends and family?
