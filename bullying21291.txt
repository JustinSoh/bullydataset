				I think that the point Inspiritus makes about considering how you'd feel if it happened to you is a good one..  slightly harsher wording than i'd use..  but a very good point to consider. <br><br><blockquote class="uncited"><div>So I'm addicted to bullying and I don't know why,<br><br>It doesn't really bother me but people say it's not normal and that I'm sick,<br><br>I just think it's funny how they're all so sensitive and it's very tempting to hurt them because of that,<br><br>Does that really make me sick? Because I honestly don't feel like it. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":neutral:" title="Neutral"></div></blockquote><br><br>^^ <br>What exactly do you gain from bullying people..?    As someone that was severely bullied myself, i have to say that even when i was crying, i still wondered what motivates a bully.. <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused"> <br><br>I used to watch them, not only as a hyper-vigilant defence mechanism thing to protect myself but always with a ''why?'' as well..<br>What could someone possibly achieve by hurting someone that's already hurting and weaker than they are..  I mean, it's a bit pathetic..  surely a real power struggle is more admirable..? <br><br>Surely it's the same principles as competing in a sport against someone of roughly the same ability as you..   <br><br>If you had a running race.. who would you feel proud to beat..?<br><br>1. someone slightly faster than you but you are determined to beat them so try and try and try again until you beat them.. the euphoria from that is amazing.. <br><br>2. a 95 year old who just had a hip replacement..<br><br><br><br>I think that there are far healthier ways of competing than bullying vulnerable people..  <br><br>aside from that.. i like the fact that you're questioning whether you have a problem..  i think that it would be a good idea for you to consider trying out some new methods of gaining power in your life.<br>I also think it would be a good idea for you to try and see the people you bully as humans with the same thoughts and feelings as you.. <br><br><br><br>Sbb.
