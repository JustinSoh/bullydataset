				About 4 months ago one of my ex friends who i owed money too (100$) told him i wasnt paying him back because he ripped me off, which I avoided him for a lil bit, he actually threw a rock through my families house window, which my dad than talked to his parents saying that he must control his son, which a month later I encountered him again, which he punched me in the nose, at the time I really didn't feel it, it happened so quick I didn't even realize it was a punch, I blame on my inexperienced fighting, a couple minutes later he punched me in the eye which right away starting gushing, than i defended myself he got him to the ground, nothing really happened after that, he and his friends drove off, got 13 stitches right under my eyebrow, a broken nose (which took about a month for me to really realize, at first I brushed it off as if it was a weak punch) and even after the first 2 months it happened I didn't care at all, it had no effect on me, no thoughts really about it or embarrassment I would even tell people that he gave me stitches on my eye<br><br>2 months ago I came to Israel and on the plane ride I was thinking about my past, a feeling of regret, and revenge, than I started to become so focussed and obsessed on this situation, now I look at peoples noses which is a reminder of the incident, noticing defects in peoples faces/bodies uncontrollably, researching personalities, personalities types, personalities disorders, types of feelings. thinking about what other people or going/been through. <br><br>I just cant seem to get over, I feel embarrassed, humiliated, ashamed, regret, coward, revenge, and that I could of easily done something to protect myself, to not get a scar and a broken nose, these feelings come and go. the scar and broken nose isn't really noticeable, but mainly the nose makes me feel uncomfortable/bad.<br><br>I am a very social person, and actually was more shy/less social active than now, I still have confidence in talking too people, meeting people, in my looks, getting girls, but have loss interests in things I once enjoyed, and feel as if my imagination/fantasizing/sex drive has decreased. I don't get nightmares, but usually once I wake up my mind will think about it, and has impacted my life greatly and don't know if it will ever go away.<br><br>All help we'll be greatly appreciated especially since I am a new member
