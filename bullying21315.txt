The unattractive people who face this treatment are brushed off, and told it isn't true, even by people who comment on other people's appearances. <br><br>Denying it just places more blame on the individual being discriminated against. It works as a negative point towards their personality. People will look for any reason to justify their hatred of unattractive people. <br><br>We need more awareness, and to cut down the denial people use to silence people who are suffering. There are studies to support it, and even after reading studies or websites (that link to studies), the comment sections still have people living in denial. Which means they have never experienced it, and refuse to understand or accept it happens. <br><br>People who bully others generally have high self esteem, and the number of narcissists is very high. They justify their behavior by placing the blame on the victim.
