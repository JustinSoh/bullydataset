				I am in the same situation as yours.<br><br>I promised myself I will not let this nightmare shape my life and that it is a valuable lesson to learn from.<br><br>I changed alot about myself and life but I still have the fear and phobia against such things.<br><br>I went to an MMA and kickboxing gym, in hopes that it will help me re-experience and overcome this phobia. It helped a little but over-all I still feel horribly fearful &amp; threatened from certain people and it reflects on the way I interact and confront them.<br><br>I feel ashamed and do not wish to be exposed and see a loved one exposed to harm or bullying and I just simply sit there paralyzed with fear &amp; anxiety.<br><br>I always tell myself that I will not let fear control my life but in still does in some cases and it very hard to switch out of this crappy mindset once this anxiety &amp; fear hits me.<br><br>It takes hours if not days, to switch back to normal mode, and it really kills me that some minor confrontations haunt me for such a long time, affecting my behavior or choices.
