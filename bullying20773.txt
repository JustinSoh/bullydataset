				My sister met her husband through a Philippines wife tours and she’s being bullied by people because of this. Her “friends” and other parents in her daughters school are spreading around rumors about her ever since they found out about it. I’m honestly bothered and hurt with how they’re treating my innocent sister. I don’t know how to comfort her and confront the situation. I need some advice on this. Can anyone help me?
