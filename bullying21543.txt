				I'll preface this; I'm diagnosed bipolar. I've withheld this following information from doctors, my family for over 15 years. I still don't know if I should tell them.<br><br>I'll do my best to describe the events. The first event may not have any causation for my problems, since it wasnt technically abuse, but it was rather disturbing... idk, I'm not a professional.<br><br>When I was 10 I moved to this town. I met my next door neighbor, *mod edit*. He was the best friend I ever had, Surprising we both wanted to be boyfriends. Surprise, perfect! God has handed me the prize of my life. The best part was we werent aware of what was going to happen... It was obvious that we were the gay kids, even at that age where sex isnt involved, we both wanted to be out. <br><br>The thing I didnt realize was that his mother would find out eventually, and she wasnt having any of it. He was swiftly grounded and was banned from interaction with me. We'd talk through his bedroom window for a while.<br><br>It wasnt 3 weeks later that they left town.<br>We were not allowed to say goodbye to each other. his mother dragged him to the car and that was the last time I saw him until about 5 years ago. I immediately made a run... I feel absolutely awful about that.<br><br>Now thats only the precursor to The next event, and theÂ 'abusers' in question knew the *mod edits*<br><br>I have to warn about harsh language, I will edit but I cant leave it out..<br><br>My memory of the events are mostly just fragments:<br><br>At the end of the school day I would go to *mod edit* Daycare Center here in the town that I live. I spent about 4-5 hours a day there while my parents worked. It was a stone throw away from my house, so it was easy to walk there. <br><br>But every day I dreaded that horrible place. The staff in question were two older women, one was a mother, her daughter that was there after school, and I think the other older woman was her mother ,or her older friend, I dont know and I really don't care.<br><br>It was a heiarchy amongst them, I was the bottom omega, I guess... <br><br>The kids were all in cahouts with the staff. <br><br>The kids would slam me with the toys, "yeah, we all know you're a ######6 q***r". How disgusting I was, etc.<br><br>the 2 staff perpetuated this... apparently they all had known about Ian and I..<br><br>"You're *mod edits* little friend, arent you"? the younger staff asked me... The verbal hazing continued regularly. <br><br>A bigger black kid in this 'group of friends' liked to open hand box me a lot, slap me and of course call me the f-word. The little girl continued to bombard me with objects. I fought back, but the staff warned me not to fight, "or they would all beat my ass". After my lip got smacked.<br><br>"Ill just get my lil daughter to kick your ass, you little f****t, or I'd do it myself.", this was affirmed by the others. "you're such a sissy you'd get beat by a girl".<br><br>I was often refused bathroom breaks until it was unbearable. The staff didnt want me "touching my queer self in the bathroom", so usually they would leave the door half open (it was a 1/2 section door) and they would watch me, shout at me for taking too long.<br><br>they taunted me about my friend, how I'll never see him again, and that theyd make sure I never would..<br><br>all the hazing became less violent as the school year went on, more verbal... I told no one as I belived I would get in trouble somehow. My mother finally removed me from the program, although im not sure why...<br><br>I cant remember much other than that. I soon became incredibly violent, taking knives to walls and furniture, pretending I was drowning/ dying, pretending that I was dead, I would sit outside and space out, I would sit on the porch were *mod edit* used to live and I would sleep there.<br><br>I wanted to kill them all... his mother, the daycare staff, the kids. I became distant from everyone, and everything felt false, like nothing was real.<br><br>I had like a weird existensial crisis, I dont know how to describe it.<br> Im too hesitant to do this with a therapist, because I'm not about to cut an hour long session, twice a week. for a fifteen year plus repression. My symptoms are pretty severe, to the point where my occupation suffers, motivation, depression, anxiety, I cant sleep or eat properly unless I smoke cannibus.<br>.
