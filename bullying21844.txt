				1.Yes<br>2.Yes<br>3. Ignored most of my life, verbally abused, sometimes 'on accident punched and slapped. Social services came when I was seven but I lied because my mother looked so scared. Bullied for two years at an all white school because I was black I was nine and ten. During all that time my parents never noticed the bruises and scars. Abusive boyfriend for three years, he tried to do stuff with me and I was strong enough to kick him out of my life. My parents only friends even knew i had a boyfriend. Didn't tell because they would just get mad. Minor now with DID depression, suicidal tendencies, cutting deep and overdosing on medication and officially despise most of my family but still love them and can't help that, even though sometimes I really wish I could. They don't know any of this, and I don't tell them mostly because I don't want them to get angry at me and 'accidentally' cause a bruise anywhere.
