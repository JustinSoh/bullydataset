				Hello, <br>I'm a 18 nearly 19 year old female.<br><br>I have been struggling with relationships ever since I started, it's been a difficult time from then til now<br>I treat all my boyfriend's like absolute $#%^, even when I try not to, like I say things to them that hurt them, or I purposely go out of my way to make them cry and beg me for stuff, like I'll break up with them, just to hear them cry and so - I laugh and I find it funny, it is so amusing to me<br>You're probably thinking that I could just change and stop being that way, but no matter how hard I try, it never works, I'll always end up hating them for the tiniest thing and doing the worst damage I can to them, and I don't feel bad about it at all, I only realize that I am truly hurting them, and I enjoy hearing or seeing them cry.<br>I was sexually/physically/mentally abused growing up in multiple foster homes, by foster brothers, foster parents, and such. I also have anxiety, and I'm quite anti-social.<br>I say to myself that none of that bothers me and I have moved on, but do I unknowingly suffer from something?<br>Why do I find it funny and amusing to hurt someone I do actually like and have feelings for. <br>It's been this way for nearly 5 years and I'm tired of myself for doing it, but it almost just comes natural now.
