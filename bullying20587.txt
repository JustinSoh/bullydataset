				How am I the bully when I get angry and strike back at others who have the intention of controlling what I can and cannot do with my body and who I may share it with just because they don't like it? I have asked before why it always has to be about right and wrong and why it always has to be about whether or not people agree. How in the blasted world can people disapprove of <span style="font-style: italic">who</span> people are in the first place and how is it possible to force innate characteristics onto other people? It's like people are making all of the excuses they can to hold onto their prejudices for LGBT's as long as possible.<br><br>I remember seeing this one person on deviantArt saying she didn't want LGBT's to marry for no reason except she was "so mad at the world."<br><br>What stick was up hers and what gave her the right to judge?<br><br>What's wrong with taking a stand for yourself and telling others that they are not allowed to treat you in a certain way and that nobody is in control of your life except you and you alone?
