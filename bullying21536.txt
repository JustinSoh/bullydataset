				I both agree and disagree with you, Metalli(ca). If you keep on letting things go, they can only get worse.  You are right in saying that, if you respond in a hurt way, they're getting what they want.  But don't forget that people respond non-verbally.  If hsieh is sitting there, cringing, they'll pick up on it.
<br>
<br>hsieh - If, like Mroses says, you have been classy and discreet, you have every right to go to the supervisor and file a formal complaint.  Throw in something like they are using work time to harass you.  And as for your own personal interactions, Mroses is right.  Another good line is, 
<br>"what have I done, for you to act so poorly?"
<br>--regardless of the response--
<br>"that's right. Nothing.  Now STOP."
<br>then just sit down.
