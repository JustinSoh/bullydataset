				Sweden is using an ombudsman program, which appears to be marginally successful. At least with an ombudsman, you know that all the proper channels will be taken. Although, the channels are typically not doing enough. <br>I disagree that there is more emphasis placed on the victim, I think it's quite the opposite and that more focus is on the bully and how to fix him/her. Olweus's program, and others like it, require a lot of resources and involvement within the community. The problem is, they employ peer mediation...asking bully and victim to 'share' responsibility for the conflict. We ask the victim, "What did you do to bring this on yourself?" That's ridiculous. It just brings further shame and embarrassment to the victim. <br>These programs try to teach empathy to children, but don't seem to be working. Most would agree empathy is innate and each person is different. I guess the question is, can we really teach children who are bullies to feel empathy? I don't know if we can. Perhaps there is research out there showing it, but I haven't been able to find any. <br>You mentioned that some children develop more socially strong and some more cognitively strong. I agree with that, and I would also add that there is another group, 'The Highly Sensitive Child', that would fall under the cognitively strong group, but with a very evolved sense of empathy and understanding. The term was coined by Dr. Elaine Aron, who has studied these children and adults for years. HSC's are often targeted by bullies which is explained in this article:<br><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://drtedzeff.com/news/preventbullying.php" rel="nofollow" onclick="this.target='_blank';">http://drtedzeff.com/news/preventbullying.php</a><!-- m --><br>These Highly Sensitive Children are our artists, our counselors, our priests....and they are being taken from us, figuratively (their spirit is crushed) and literally (bullycide), because their sensitivity is vilified. <br><br>It is terrible that your son was bullied and it is good that you did not for one second ask what 'he' did to bring it on himself. Some children are just sociopaths and get pleasure out of hurting others.
