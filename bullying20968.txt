But it's a massive subject.  It's not just "not an easy solution".  It'll depend very much on the country and culture that the person lives in.  What resources they know about and have access to.  What support and education there is locally preventing bullying.  The content of the bullying.  And so on.  <br><br>For myself I don't think it can be tackled by a single approach.  Some responses need to be from Government [in the form of laws and their enforcement], some from local authorities [regional responses, school / workplace initiatives] and some at a social and at a personal level.
