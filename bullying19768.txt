				I'm drunk now so i'll be honest or i'm too shy
<br>bear with me moderators
<br>
<br>
<br>I used to be bullied
<br>now I've formed a sexual desire for sadism/bullies. I like to fall in love with "the predator". It's really interesting actually. I want to feel like "prey" and lure the bullies and it sexually gratifies me. Anything predatory turns me on now. Like people who talk crap about me all the time, block me etc. I touch myself when that happens. I fantacize about it. I think i've become a sort of sexual masochist.
<br>I was never into sex anyway, so I feel as if someone's hatred would turn me on.
<br>
<br>So i'm sure no someone will come pu with something "smart" to say about this post i just made.... i'll probably just cum reading his/her words. So bring it on! yeah this is sex!
<br>
<br>and i won't care what you have to spew, i'll touch myself!
