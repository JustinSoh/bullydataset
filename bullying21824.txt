				Oracle, what a sad, sweet story! You're right, love makes a lot of difference. Having people who are fond of me or even love me is what makes a difference in my life, it's great isn't it? Having a little creature who needs you, like a pet, helps a lot too. <br>You've really turned your life around, and you did it by standing on your own two feet and fighting for happiness and survival, be proud of yourself.<br>We have a forum for self injury too, and a few for depression. I hope you enjoy this place!
