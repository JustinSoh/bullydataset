				hi gang,
<br>
<br>I hoped that I would never need this forum. 
<br>My son is 12/13 yrs old. I have raised him, that his opinion
<br>mattered and he has a great sense of "self"
<br>
<br>He is NOT aggressive. 
<br>
<br>He has been bullied by the same kid(there are others too) since
<br>2nd grade. We tried everything with this bully, ignoring him, reporting him(there is supposed to be zero tolerance on bullying.
<br>
<br>What is going on at these schools, the woman agreed with me that my son had been bullied, LAST year, she even recalled the names they called him, nerd, geek. The school does NOTHiNG. They acknowledge that they know about the bullying but do nothing.  
<br>I am at a lose to what to do.
<br>
<br>Sad,
<br>Red
