				In 2011 I started going to a school, everything was okay. But after some weeks one of my IT teachers started deleting my work secretly from my account, she gave me after school detentions and accused me of things I didn't do, I could handle that but then kids started picking on me because I was not from their country, if your wondering where I'm from it's Latvia, I was taller and physically more fit then most of the boys in that school, probably because in my country we weren't that rich, I wasn't playing consoles since I was 4 like most of them. In that same year a few hard lads wanted to get a fight with me, you know show who's the man and $#%^, well the first one got a broken nose and the teachers had to  send him to the hospital, I was only 12 at the time, the second and third one didn't win me either, after this the teachers thought of me as an aggressive pupil who couldn't control his anger, after every fight I became more isolated from the kids in school, the teachers thought of me bad and stuff like that, I didn't have any friends by the end of the year and in the start of second year in 2012, one more hard lad wanted to test his luck, we'll call him Jimmy. Jimmy got up from behind me and punched me in the head, I turned around and slammed him in to the wall, the teachers ran in, guess who they were protecting? The brave boy Jimmy who got viciously attacked by that aggressive pupil from another country. I was more isolated, who would want to be friends with an aggressive pupil from another country right? I got my after school detention as always and Jimmy was declared a hero. <br><br>In that same year we got a PE teacher, let's call him Beggsie. Because of the country I live in football for them is "life", we did football the whole time and surprise surprise, I wasn't good at it. I was picked always last and Beggsie was always commenting on me and how "bad" I am at it, because of that I stopped doing it, had detentions for not bringing my PE kit and stuff.. My mother sent a school letter explaining all this, guess what, 3rd year in school, 2013. Beggsie got promoted to our Head Year. He also was our history teacher and taught us jack $#%^. We got a new English teacher who was a total dick, the biggest dick in the school. He did everything what all those other teachers did. <br><br>I somehow survived 3rd year and went on 4th, it was all quiet for a while that year until my "friend" wanted to fight with me for some reason in the morning. He came up, I broke his nose and again he was declared a brave hero and I was sitting in isolation for a week. We also that year got a new English teacher which was a vice principal and he was a total dick to us. The only thing that kept him from eating me whole was the other VP who was kinda good to me. The only teacher that was good to me. <br><br>5th year, they all know it's my last year and it all started again, 2 English teachers, 1 geography teacher, 1 PE and 1 VP. The only teacher that was good to me the second VP, last week said $#%^ about my country in the school assembly. This is not even half of the year and this is all happening all at same time, last week I was walking down a corridor with my friend and that geography teacher came up from behind and just started talking literal $#%^. I had problems with him before that year, he said because I wasn't doing "football" I wasn't physically fit and that it is illegal or some $#%^, I laughed my ass off when he said that it's illegal to be physically unfit knowing that every once a year we had a real physical test and I came in first always, I know the PE teachers didn't like that one bit. I told him to ###$ off and we just walked off, I didn't get anything for telling him that but I think i've only made things worse. Any help or solution to this #######4? It's my last year and I know it's going to be the hardest.
