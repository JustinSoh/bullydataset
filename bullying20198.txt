I really want to hit you and I am having a hard time getting over what you just said about you hitting a "retarded" female. I hit women too, but I would NEVER hit a "retarded" female. SHE CAN'T DEFEND OR SPEAK UP FOR HERSELF!!!! You are a sick piece of $#%^ and if I could honestly find your address, you would be dead and I would be in jail right now. That just makes me sooo mad!! How could you do something like that, even if you were a child?! You would be very wise to look for her, even if it cost you your life. "88snow88", do not say it is a "common human mistake", what he did is unforgiveable and he didn't think of how that other being felt. The person he was fuking with did not see it as a common human mistake when she was crying, neither should he.   <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad">  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad">  <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_mad.gif" alt=":x" title="Mad"></div></blockquote>
