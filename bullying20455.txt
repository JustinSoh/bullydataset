				ok im 20 and first of all i want to say it really sucks writing here.its pathetic to me.but i cant help it. its true i got bullied and its true im affected by it.<br>    So the period in which i got bullied the mos was from the 4th grade to 8th grade. Because of 3 boys. They criticised every thing of me. Hair,skin,body,nails,nose,smell etc. As soon as someone of them said something about me,the other immediately joined,saying other things. I was alone against 3. I coulnt handle them. I have to admitt one of them(im not mention his name because this writing appears on google search,ill just call him Dox--),which was very strange from his behaivour because he was the only one that wanted to spend time with me. He always called me and take me out of the house. But anyway,hey did those bullying at lunch time or during the class. And i remember being really hurt back then.Dox had a really vivid imagination ,its true. Some of the things he said about me even made me laugh sometimes. But most of the time it just made me sad. They terrified the other boys too,because the other boys just keep quiet.I didnt,i stood up but there came a point where i could say nothing no more. I prayed they change school or die often. Sometimes their jokes about me were so funny that even teachers and other classmates laughed. My ears where always up to listen to them.What they will insult me this time. That guy Dox became like an idol to me.Because when not at school around the other classmates. He was non offensive to me. We used to hang out. Hes the one who i learned cigarettes and weed from. He was super social and type of bad boy.Very talkative and seducing in the way he talked. We also had many things in common. He once said: you are like me but i cant stand the fact that i can be like you.<br>   I was so hopeless when Dox and the other 2 boys insulted me that it became the only thing i thought about.and without knowing i started using some of his phrases,even talk like him. <br><br>                                                                                          thats it for now
