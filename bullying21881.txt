				My 10 year old daughter has been consistent teased for her quiet and shy nature by classmates since she was 8 years old, but the problems have recently escalated. Our family is considered upper middle class, as are her peers, though I have noticed that many of her peers come from single mother households, where the mother is in serious relationship with a boyfriend, but some of these kids lack a father's attention. Other kids do come from wealthy families with two parents. All the students are of average intelligence, or slightly above, and, with uniforms, most students look very similar.<br><br>My daughter is very kind, sweet, and a dedicated student. She's very pretty, thin, (she's modeled in the past) and concerned with cleanliness. She's remiss when she's unable to achieve straight A's, though she never brags to peers. Her hobbies would appeal to any introverted child - she draws, paints, swims and presses flowers after school and on weekends. Her mother is a stay at home mom and I attend most of her activities when I am off work. However, she's recently become the target of teasing among peers. She tells me her classmates mock her for being "too nice", not swearing, actually doing her homework, or for failing to wear a skirt (she's a bit of a tomboy).<br><br>Last week at school at school, a female classmate offered her a cookie, which my daughter accepted and ate, only to have another classmate tell her later on that same school day that that female classmate had spat on the cookie before giving it to my daughter! I am furious with these children! I went to the school, to complain, only to have my daughter's homeroom teacher tell us that "kids will be kids" and that "[our] daughter should ignore her classmates". <br><br>What gives?! What's a father to do? What are the motivations of these children? I am attempting to be analytical here, but I'm without words.   <img src="https://www.psychforums.com/images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad"> Any advice would be helpful .
