				Hi , I don't know if anyone will see this as the post is a year old, but I empathize - I was bullied all the way through school... it started in pre-school actually, they used to tickle me till I had asthma attacks in preschool.. and now I am 52, and still so angry about it I want to find my ex-bullies and ask them why they did it.  the worst after effect for me is rage, and severely paranoid attitudes to people... I have little faith in the goodness of humankind. <br>I hate this about myself. I have sought help, I have read books, beem on programmes to deal with anger management... I wish I could stop being so angry... it is / has ruined my life nearly<br>designomoly
