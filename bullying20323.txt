				There's a gap between how the school has responded and how the other parents responded, but I don't think it's fair to confuse the two.  From what you've said, yes, your son did bully another child.  That child and her parents have dealt with it and moved-on, and it seems like your son has too, he's friends with the child's brother again and [presumably] hasn't bullied anyone else since.  <br><br>The consequences from the school are separate to that.  They may have a zero tolerance policy, which means that a one-off incident of calling names is treated in the same way as repeatedly punching someone.  I think that may end up disproportionate, either over-punishing him or under-punishing worse bullying, but again it's separate from the reaction and behaviour of the victim's parents.  They will probably have had very little input into the reaction of the school.  <br><br>I think you are taking the right approach in attempting to get clarity about this from the school.  In my own opinion [and I am just a random person on the internet, I don't know anything about this other than what you've said] I don't think it's helpful to dispute whether it was bullying or not.  And the seriousness of it all seems to come down to the reaction of the school, not to the behaviour of the other parents.<br><br>What do you want to happen?
